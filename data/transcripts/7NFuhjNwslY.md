# Release Recap for September 2023 #tailscale

**[00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7NFuhjNwslY&t=0s)** Here's the Tailscale release recap for September. Did you know you can use Tailscale inside VS Code? We made some major updates to the extension's Machine Explorer feature, meaning you can interact with any node on your tailnet and any file on any node on your tailnet, all from the comfort of your favourite editor. Find the extension in the VS Code marketplace. We made some updates to Funnel, the Tailscale tool that lets you share a port on your local host with the entire internet, and serve the super-simple server behind Funnel.

**[00:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7NFuhjNwslY&t=31s)** So it's your first time using these features, you might need to tweak your ACLs, and we've made a brand new web-based guide to help you do that.

**[00:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7NFuhjNwslY&t=37s)** And finally, some exciting news for the InfoSec crowd, the professionally paranoid amongst us. Tailnet Lock is now officially in beta. This allows you to verify that no node is added to your tailnet without being signed by a trusted node in your tailnet.

**[00:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7NFuhjNwslY&t=50s)** When Tailnet Lock is enabled, even if the Tailscale infrastructure becomes maliciously compromised or hacked in some way, attackers can't send or receive traffic on your tailnet.
