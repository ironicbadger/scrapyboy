# Ask a Tailscale Expert

**[00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=0s)** Welcome to Alex. I love answering questions too, and Alex loves answering questions too. So let's get the questions rolling, and I'll take five or 10 minutes to show some cool little side projects that have been building around Tailscale. Absolutely. So the general idea is, yeah, I have a dub I can hear myself twice now. It's fun. So the general idea is that we like, oh, I can't deal with that.

**[00:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=34s)** The general idea is that we've got the YouTube live chat going on one side, and we've got a Zoom chat going on the other, and Lee is going on it to the Zoom side, I want it to the YouTube side. Once we've got that all figured out, then we should be good to go. So if you have any questions for us, pop them in the YouTube chat, and we'll do our best to get them.

**[00:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=55s)** We've also got another webinar coming up. When's the next date for the next webinar? I want to give that little plug.

**[01:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=62s)** Hopefully our trusty backing team can get that. I don't have that to hand trusty support team in the background.

**[01:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=69s)** June the 4th apparently. So yeah, we've got one of these coming up pretty soon next month, so.

**[01:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=79s)** Great.

**[01:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=81s)** OK, I'm going to do a little bit of show and tell I've three, yes, three different projects that I've been working on.

**[01:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=89s)** And this is live demo. I haven't practiced any of this. I'm just going to go off the cuff. So if it doesn't work, it's my terrible code that doesn't work.

**[01:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=98s)** So let's go and start there and share my screen.

**[01:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=102s)** OK, hopefully you can see everybody can see my screen. Can you see my screen? That's what everybody has to say, right?

**[01:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=108s)** OK, first thing.

**[01:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=111s)** We have been talking to lots of companies about connectivity around AI because one of our largest customer profiles is AI companies.

**[02:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=121s)** If you go and look at all the logos on our website, and as the very.

**[02:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=127s)** You know, interesting phenomenon of being able to connect AI things to your data so they can slip up all that data and then regurgitate it back to you.

**[02:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=138s)** One of the things that was interesting for some customers is the ability to be able to interface with their tail scale tail net with a model context protocol server.

**[02:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=147s)** So I put together a modern context protocol server. You can see it here with Claude.

**[02:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=153s)** So I'm able to actually retrieve information directly from my tail net and like have AI tell me a bunch of stuff that I can probably figure out myself.

**[02:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=165s)** This is interesting to some people. It was an interesting exercise. We need to be able to build something like this so that you can actually understand how the protocol works.

**[02:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=174s)** I think there's a lot of exciting things in this space, but a lot of concerning things from my personal privacy point of view, but that's just my personal opinion.

**[03:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=182s)** But this allows me to be able to actually like ask questions of the tail net.

**[03:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=187s)** So you can see you've built a couple of tools, which will allow me to get specific device info and list all devices.

**[03:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=194s)** And then we have this consideration of like what a model context protocol calls a server.

**[03:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=199s)** And that will actually dump a whole bunch of information into the into the client, which is called desktop.

**[03:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=208s)** And I can ask it questions.

**[03:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=212s)** And it will pass this information and provide varying degrees of quality to the actual AI server.

**[03:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=222s)** So, you know, this is a little hobby experiment. If anybody's interested in taking this for a try or at least contributing to it, you know, I'm very open to contribute contributions here.

**[03:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=233s)** But this I thought was something that is very popular in the space right now and a lot of our customers are asking about it. So that's show and tell number one.

**[04:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=243s)** All right, let me ask you some questions because I have a couple.

**[04:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=247s)** It can hook into your tail net and I think you mentioned this, but it's using the tail scale API to query this information.

**[04:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=255s)** Yes, so essentially a model context protocol is something that you run that actually provides feeds information into your into the AI LL and right.

**[04:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=266s)** And so this particular one is running on my local machine and I will show you how it's configured, but it's got an API key in there. So I'm not going to do that.

**[04:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=275s)** And what it does is like makes an API call to the tail scale API and then returns a whole bunch of JSON. So you can actually see the results of that here.

**[04:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=285s)** And this is like the JSON that's come back very good.

**[04:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=288s)** Yeah, and so like the model context protocol is really new and is really early and there's a lot of things here that are like, you know, like still influx and still being built.

**[05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=300s)** So right now a lot of people are running these locally on their devices. I personally am really excited about the possibility of being able to use tail skills, like permission capabilities to be able to actually leverage, you know, which part of your API, which part of your machine can actually talk to.

**[05:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=317s)** I can talk a little bit more about that in the next show and tell, but essentially that's what it's doing. It's just funneling information into it.

**[05:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=324s)** I mean, theoretically, you could do a curl call and copy and paste this into into the into the chat box, right? But like, you know, for non technical users, these MCP servers are really helpful to be able to kind of funnel this information in basically.

**[05:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=341s)** So what does the architecture for this this setup kind of look like? I mean, could you like could you open it and escalator or something and draw us a quick like little pictures to.

**[05:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=350s)** It's really simple. It's literally a binary that runs on the machine and then the binary and I can, I can like, let me go and bring it up here.

**[05:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=359s)** Because I think for me, that's been I haven't experimented with any MCPs at all yet. And it's definitely on my list, because I think that's where things are going.

**[06:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=366s)** So this is the actual code. And I've, you know, most people are writing MCPs in Python, but I can't stand the language. So I written it in and go.

**[06:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=374s)** And it's literally just a binary that's running locally on my machine and you pass in an API key and then it returns a bunch of JSON.

**[06:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=380s)** Now there are organizations that are running these on your behalf. So like you can run them in the cloud and you call them of HTTP and there's a whole bunch of effects.

**[06:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=388s)** But this is literally just running locally for me. And, and, you know, and then it calls out to the tailscale API when you make a request basically.

**[06:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=398s)** Well, that makes a ton of sense. So it's just a local binary on your system that's effectively acting as like a, a go between between the different.

**[06:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=405s)** Yeah, exactly, exactly.

**[06:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=407s)** Yeah. It's like the, the next version of it's like API 2.0 if you want to think of it a little bit.

**[06:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=412s)** Exactly, exactly. Yeah.

**[06:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=415s)** So that's the like part one of my little experiments over the last few weeks.

**[07:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=422s)** Part two is a little bit more of like a personal thing and everyone's just seeing a little highlight into some of the functionality we're going to be building with our multi tailnet stuff there as I switch between tail nets in a single window.

**[07:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=436s)** If you're going to comment on that because I was going to quietly not mention it, but everybody's seeing it now and it's recording live on YouTube.

**[07:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=445s)** So then another thing that I personally have been like working on. So we have a terraform provider. So let's just bring that up terraform provider.

**[07:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=455s)** We have a terraform provider, which will allow you to manage ACLs, right.

**[07:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=459s)** And I mentioned this it last few weeks ago. And there's a resource here that allows you to build an ACL.

**[07:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=465s)** This resource in terraform expects you to send the actual ACL as a full file, right.

**[07:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=473s)** And so you have to build it out and it's a single file and you can see here it's like a big string.

**[07:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=478s)** What I've always wanted to be able to do is manage each parts of these ACL in a more granular way.

**[08:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=484s)** And what I mean by that is I would like to be able to do resource ACL and then a single ACL or resource group and then a single group that then gets concatenated into a big, you know, into a like a big string at the end of it.

**[08:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=499s)** So I built something to do that. And I call it tackle, which is tail scale.

**[08:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=504s)** I've all I've been looking for a reason to register a new domain name. So here we are.

**[08:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=510s)** And this will actually it's creates an API that will allow you to actually like send requests to a like an intermediary server.

**[08:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=523s)** And then it will build all like you find out ACL for you. So you can see here, like I can actually put an exist update in a single ACL entry or get a single ACL entry from a server.

**[08:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=536s)** What's really interesting about this is that I've leveraged like tail scales application capabilities to be able to define which ACL and points that you're able to use.

**[09:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=546s)** And I added a telephone provider on top of it. So this has been being built for like the last few months.

**[09:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=551s)** I now use this to manage most of my ACLs. It's definitely not production ready and it's more a proof of concept.

**[09:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=557s)** But what does that look like in reality? Well, let's show you what this looks like.

**[09:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=562s)** So you can see I can actually now declare a single ACL with an action or sauce and a protocol or a single group with a name and members.

**[09:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=571s)** And then I can actually think of these in a similar way as like AWS security groups or Azure security groups.

**[09:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=577s)** And I can build an entire file over time.

**[09:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=580s)** So what does that look like in reality? If I do telephone supply.

**[09:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=585s)** It's going to show me that it's going to add a single ACL and all that kind of stuff. I'll hit yes, it's added that.

**[09:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=591s)** And so in the background, like tackle has received an API request. It's like grabbed a bunch of stuff and I've added it.

**[10:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=600s)** And then eventually it builds that and then it will sink the ACL up to tail scale as like a single action.

**[10:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=605s)** So we have like an intermediary state here. So you can see here I pushed a local ACL to tail scale.

**[10:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=610s)** If I go look at the audit logs, you should be able to see it just added this section.

**[10:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=616s)** It didn't add anything else, right? Like I'm not managing it all as a single file.

**[10:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=620s)** It's a much more granular way. And so what are the use cases for this? If you have multiple teams that want to manage a tail scale ACL.

**[10:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=628s)** And you don't want people to be able to break certain parts of it, but other parts of it.

**[10:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=632s)** This is a really great way of being able to do that. And you can see I can actually see.

**[10:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=635s)** Look, it's added my my single ACL.

**[10:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=638s)** And then I can obviously do terra form.

**[10:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=641s)** Destroy. And similar situation. It will eventually.

**[10:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=646s)** So you can see that's the delete that happened again on the into intermediary server.

**[10:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=651s)** And then it will run a sink and it will push it up there.

**[10:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=654s)** So this is something that I like coming from an infrastructures code background or coming from a like an infrastructure background.

**[11:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=662s)** This is something I've always wanted to be able to do.

**[11:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=666s)** And you know that this has been kind of useful for me to be able to manage these things in a little bit more of a granular way.

**[11:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=672s)** And you can see the delete operation there.

**[11:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=674s)** Again, definitely not production ready. Definitely not something you should do a new production talent.

**[11:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=679s)** But I am looking for people to try this out and like find bugs and help me figure out how this has been a work in the long term.

**[11:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=686s)** So where can we, where can we send people to find more information?

**[11:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=689s)** Get dash tackle.com.

**[11:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=692s)** And then there is a GitHub repo of tackle.

**[11:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=698s)** And I separate my GitHub repose for like, this is a personal project that I'm not going to support into Jack Stone,

**[11:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=705s)** which is my my like, keep personal GitHub.

**[11:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=708s)** And then the LBL apps which I kind of like, I'm going to keep building and working on.

**[11:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=713s)** This is kind of in the LBL apps thing here.

**[11:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=716s)** So lots of documentation also got API docs out here as well.

**[12:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=721s)** I've tried to build this as like from first principles, but I've really enjoyed building this and I really enjoyed using it as well.

**[12:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=727s)** So hopefully I can't see the chat hopefully.

**[12:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=730s)** You know, we'll see some people kind of give this a try and see what it looks like.

**[12:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=734s)** Yeah, I think we've been able to do what's called get ups with your ACLs for a while.

**[12:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=740s)** But as you say, it's not been particularly granular the way you can do that.

**[12:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=745s)** I think what's interesting about this is in particular way,

**[12:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=748s)** terraform structures, it's, it's input files.

**[12:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=751s)** You can literally have a grants file, an ACLs file, an SSH file and just keep things very distinct and very, you know, separated.

**[12:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=759s)** So I think it's a great concept.

**[12:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=761s)** I mean, I don't know about anything else.

**[12:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=762s)** I just really enjoyed it as well.

**[12:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=764s)** Yeah, I really enjoyed building it.

**[12:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=766s)** I really like actually, I'm going to see if I can go off book a little bit here.

**[12:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=769s)** So we can see here actually uses this create to like tail scale nodes.

**[12:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=774s)** You can see it here as tackle.

**[12:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=776s)** And then we use the application grants stuff to be able to like determine which things you're able to actually manage.

**[13:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=785s)** So I made this pretty broad.

**[13:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=787s)** But for example, I could allow somebody to only do get get requests from from here, right,

**[13:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=795s)** which would mean that if I try to do a post request, like modify the ACL, I can't actually do that.

**[13:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=803s)** And this is all built into tail scales application capabilities.

**[13:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=806s)** So actually, like, you know, you can see that it's kind of linked to admin here and it's linked to certain destinations.

**[13:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=813s)** The ability to be able to do that is like a very tail scale thing.

**[13:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=816s)** And I think I could do a whole webinar on tail scale application capabilities.

**[13:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=819s)** But this is really exciting.

**[13:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=820s)** I didn't need to build any authentication.

**[13:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=822s)** It's all kind of coming directly from the tail scale capabilities, which I think is cool.

**[13:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=826s)** Okay.

**[13:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=829s)** The last one is a little bit more simpler.

**[13:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=832s)** But like, I've been meaning to build this for like a long, long time.

**[13:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=836s)** And I thought it was going to take too long.

**[13:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=838s)** But I leveraged.

**[14:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=840s)** So I like bootstrapped a CLI tool, which will allow me to interact with the tail scale API via a CLI tool.

**[14:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=851s)** And this has been something that I've been looking to build for a long time.

**[14:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=855s)** But I'm slowly building it out.

**[14:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=858s)** And so you can do things like get list set and delete.

**[14:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=861s)** So if I do Tuske TTS CLI, I did list devices.

**[14:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=866s)** Let's get a node ID.

**[14:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=868s)** And then I can do get device.

**[14:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=872s)** I can't look at the fallout right now.

**[14:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=875s)** Device is this and then do all.

**[14:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=878s)** And it will allow me to actually interact with the, the, the tail scale API directly over a CLI.

**[14:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=884s)** I'm building this out very slowly.

**[14:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=886s)** And it will have, I expect it to have before capabilities of the API to be able to interact with our CLI tool.

**[14:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=894s)** Because I, there's lots of parts of the API that you kind of want to use on a regular basis that you need to use curl commands for.

**[15:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=900s)** And I was like, I'm just going to build a CLI tool for this.

**[15:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=902s)** So if you ever really wanted to be able to talk to your tail scale API over the, over a CLI tool, you can now do that.

**[15:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=909s)** And that is at.

**[15:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=913s)** TS CLI.

**[15:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=915s)** So I started this last night and leverage some LLMs to speed it up.

**[15:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=921s)** I've personally found that I can be way more productive with LLMs if I feed it what I like my example code.

**[15:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=928s)** And then it kind of like fleshes the stuff around for me.

**[15:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=931s)** But this has been really helpful for me as well.

**[15:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=933s)** I've been using this all last few days as well.

**[15:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=935s)** So those are my three show and tells a lot, a lot of ground to cover there.

**[15:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=939s)** But hopefully some people will find this stuff useful.

**[15:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=942s)** Yeah. I mean, some of those could literally have been an entire episode by themselves.

**[15:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=947s)** I know. I just jammed it into 50 minutes.

**[15:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=949s)** Yeah.

**[15:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=950s)** Really cool stuff.

**[15:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=951s)** Let's take some questions.

**[15:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=953s)** Indeed. Let's do it.

**[15:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=954s)** Why many people are here?

**[15:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=956s)** All right.

**[15:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=957s)** So I just want to point out that Numer in the chat said that your multi-tailnet quick.

**[16:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=963s)** I don't know if it was a slip or a purposeful show intentional show made his day.

**[16:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=969s)** So there you go.

**[16:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=971s)** Glad to hear it.

**[16:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=972s)** All right. So first question I can see right here is can I force tail scale to require two factor every time I connect to something.

**[16:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=980s)** I'm using a business Microsoft account.

**[16:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=984s)** Yes.

**[16:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=985s)** So a very common question that we get about tail scale is like, can I bring my own identity like username and password and the answer that we have for that kind of philosophically is no.

**[16:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=997s)** We don't want to start passwords.

**[16:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=998s)** We want to have that be the responsibility of the provider that you have linked to your tail scale account over our IDC.

**[16:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1006s)** So if you want to use MFA with your tailnet, it is the responsibility of the identity provided you have attached to your tailnet to be able to enforce that.

**[16:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1018s)** So there is no setting in tail scale to enforce MFA you enforce the MFA on Google or doctor or Microsoft or whatever your backing identity provider is.

**[17:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1028s)** And then that will require you to use MFA there.

**[17:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1031s)** But you can't do it directly on the tail scale like settings because we want to pass the responsibility off of like identifying who you are to things that are better at doing that rather than was having to build an entire identity provider.

**[17:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1044s)** We have like I think we have five support questions last week saying I want to use my own email and password.

**[17:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1050s)** We have no plans to build that it's just not going to happen because, you know, we're a security company and we want to pass that security responsibility off to companies that are, you know, building identity providers like octa and that is their core competency.

**[17:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1064s)** So you can run your own IDC provider that is something that we support.

**[17:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1069s)** And so I think Alex has done some videos and running your own IDC.

**[17:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1073s)** Very recently to pocket ID is a good one authentic is another good one.

**[17:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1078s)** Yeah. Yeah.

**[17:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1079s)** And again, if you want to use MFA with those, it's the responsibility of that LIDC provided to enforce MFA.

**[18:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1085s)** And so hopefully that answers the question.

**[18:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1087s)** Don't forget you can also specifically talking about SSH here.

**[18:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1091s)** You can set what's it called check mode which which enforces every time you make a tail scale SSH connection.

**[18:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1098s)** Which enforces you to have the user log in and reauthenticate every time in a browser session or some other way of doing like a two factor.

**[18:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1107s)** So the answer is yes, with a couple of caveat cherries on top, but nothing too significant. Yes, I think is a fair answer there.

**[18:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1116s)** Alright, so the next question comes in. Here's something I've never been able to quite figure out.

**[18:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1120s)** How does tail scale do cross private subnet routing discovery? For instance, in a scenario where I'm on the same 1918 subnet as a peer or when I'm a different subnet.

**[18:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1133s)** But where, but where I know that I've got a layer three routes to the peer, how does tail scale discover this and avoid hairpinning via public egress.

**[19:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1143s)** I actually talked to one of our engineers about this today and I think all comes back to how we take the end points that we have for a client to be able to connect to you.

**[19:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1154s)** So when you go into the tail scale dashboard or if you run tail scale net check, you'll see that inside every tail scale device, there is an end point table.

**[19:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1165s)** It's under the machine details and you'll probably notice in that end points table, there's a whole long list of IP addresses such as your public IP address also has your local IP address as well.

**[19:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1175s)** So like your 192.168 that your route is handed to you or whatever, you know, whatever your route is standing out.

**[19:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1183s)** And the way that we the tail scale connects to each device is it uses those end points to be able to actually connect them.

**[19:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1190s)** So the short answer for how it figures out to use the right endpoint is it sends an actual request over to every single one of those end points in parallel and then whichever one responds the fastest is the one that it uses for a connection.

**[20:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1205s)** So obviously, if you send a request out through the public endpoint like to the public endpoint, it will go out through your internet connection and then back in again, that's going to take a little bit longer than it is, if you just send it to the 192.168 address that's kind of directly next to it.

**[20:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1223s)** And so the way that it does that is actually relatively simple like send a request to all end points in one go figure out which is the shortest path and then use that as the connection, but we do occasionally see that sometimes that can actually create some problems.

**[20:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1237s)** So like if you have let's say you have two ISPs sometimes you can actually find that if one of those ISPs is like flopping off Lakey that you will send a request to an endpoint that is like the lowest latency, but then the response never comes back because the internet went away in that time.

**[20:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1256s)** But that's the real way that it does is the end points table and those end points are registered with our DURP servers and then it gets sent out in the net map that goes to the rest of the network.

**[21:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1266s)** It is kind of magic and there was there was a call that I was on this is about 18 months ago now with two of the founding engineers, so people that literally wrote the product wrote wrote some of the core code of the product and they set up a couple of containers that were 100% isolated from each other on the same local host.

**[21:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1288s)** There was no there was no way to send packets between them and there were containers the only thing they could do was talk out to the internet was the only thing they could do.

**[21:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1296s)** And to their surprise on this call in real time those two containers found a route between each other on that same host without leaving the box using the same mechanisms that we just described.

**[21:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1306s)** They were very surprised that day so you know it's something you can sometimes even surprise us just how you know computers can find routes that perhaps we didn't even think of.

**[21:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1316s)** Indeed so speaking of custom routes and what kind of stuff there's a question in here about tail scale DURP servers.

**[22:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1324s)** Is there a way to unblock or perhaps set up my own tail scale DURP server.

**[22:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1329s)** Yes, but it is highly it is very much your mileage may vary and you kind of on your own when you do that what is what is a DURP server and why would someone need one.

**[22:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1342s)** Yeah so a DURP server is the intermediary thing that we use for discovery of like where you are in the world and is also used for relaying packets in difficult networks so you we tell scale runs a fleet of DURP servers around the world.

**[22:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1358s)** We just added a couple of regions in the last few weeks in order to kind of give our customers the best experience and they usually most effective when they are geographically located very close to the two clients that you are wanting to use.

**[22:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1369s)** The reason we generally don't recommend running your own DURP server is because it is requires very specific situation so you need it to be on the public Internet and you should have an IPv4 and IPv6 IP address attached to it and it also needs to generally be highly available which means you need to set up meshing and out of mesh key and a whole bunch of other stuff.

**[23:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1392s)** We just like my solutions engineering team does not have the capacity to support everybody who wants to run their own DURP server so the DURP server code is open source it's in the telescope repo and you can run it and build it and actually run it as you need to I run my own DURP servers because I like to understand how they work.

**[23:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1411s)** But generally it's not recommended once you have got your DURP server up and running then you need to add it to your tailnet to DURP map and so there's like a way of actually specifying that you have your own DURP server in the DURP map which is a part of the ACL.

**[23:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1431s)** I have offered to help certain organizations to run their own DURP server is like a personal favor but I just don't have the capacity to get 100 emails from people telling me they want to run their own DURP server so yeah it's just generally not a it's not something that we generally recommend basically.

**[24:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1450s)** Yeah here be dragons. There are plenty of foot guns available if you if you let it so there's a question from Anthony in the zoom chat asking about different connecting different business entities can you give us a bit more info Anthony in the Q&A on zoom and then we'll get to that one once you give us a bit more to go on.

**[24:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1470s)** So there's a question here saying I'm new to tail scale during our testing period all worked fine but some of our mapped drives kept dropping and this didn't happen when they were on a typical SSL VPN any ideas.

**[24:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1483s)** I'm guessing it's probably Samba so Samba is particularly tricky for most VPNs to work my guess and I don't know for sure but my guess is that you were probably being duped as we call it to probably being relayed through our DURP network and Samba is really really bad at latency sensitive connections.

**[25:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1509s)** So if you get your telescope configuration to get direct connections Samba usually works a lot better in those circumstances but it's not a protocol that was really designed to be used in those kind of high latency situations without more information it's not really super obvious but that would be my best guess I think.

**[25:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1530s)** Yeah absolutely NFS if you've ever done any NFS with tail scale.

**[25:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1536s)** Plenty yeah it works really well I mean NFS is pretty pretty good at latency sensitive situations so I especially NFS V Falls pretty good but you know I spent most of my career as an infrastructure engineer and anytime anybody says let's do this little latency thing over a high latency connection I'm like cool this is going to be fun.

**[25:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1556s)** Yeah let's just run it CD distributed across three continents.

**[26:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1560s)** I literally have done that before and it is not a fun experience but you know there's only so much we can do about the speed of light Alex you know it is what it is like it is a very much fixed constant so yeah.

**[26:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1573s)** Transcontinental bandwidth to is not cheap so it gets prioritized in different ways than stuff that stays on a specific continent you know you can see you can see it pretty clearly if you if you put a server in a different you know different geo.

**[26:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1588s)** You can see it pretty clearly like the ping times are way higher than the speed of light would be for that same distance just because I don't know I don't know how the ISPs do it they must like batch up packets somehow unlike just to try and you know maximize the throughput of the pipes or something.

**[26:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1603s)** I'm totally making this up but like.

**[26:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1605s)** We have you should ask you to just ask one of James I'm going to give his last name so we don't bother with questions but James yeah.

**[26:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1612s)** James is the sort of person who knows the answer to those questions.

**[26:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1615s)** I will say one of one of our favorite things when we're on the S.E. team is somebody saying hey I'm having a really poor experience with tail scale right now can you explain why I'm like no but it will look into it and it's actually usually an undersea cable cut that means that the routing traffic in a different path now I'm like yeah we can't do anything about that it's just the way it is.

**[27:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1632s)** You know like again there's only so much we can do about the speed of light you know.

**[27:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1637s)** Yeah do I talk a little bit about you and your team at tail scale and some of the things that people can do to get in touch with you.

**[27:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1644s)** Yes so we are the solutions engineering team we work with closely with our support team so you've ever emailed support at tail scale that calm you get our support team.

**[27:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1653s)** The solutions engineering team is for customers who are looking to adopt or grow their expand grow their usage of tail scale so.

**[27:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1660s)** You are already a tail scale customer and you are thinking about for example signing a yearly contract so you don't have to pay as much money and it's more of a yearly commitment or if you have a specific new use case in which you are going from 10 to 100 users.

**[27:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1674s)** Or if you are thinking about a new use case it's going to expand your usage of tail scale or getting rid of another VPN that you no longer like using you can contact us either via the sales contact form.

**[28:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1686s)** You know trusty back in marketing team can help us out with that with that link or if you want to talk directly to a solution engineer we have an email address which is s me.

**[28:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1696s)** Sugar echo at tail scale calm and that's staffed by my team we are 10 strong now so we're getting we're growing rapidly yeah.

**[28:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1706s)** Yes they're indeed alright so a couple of things there is some follow up from Anthony in the zoom chat Lee if you take a quick read of that i'm going to cover off one of the YouTube questions whilst you do that.

**[28:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1715s)** Yes so Anthony's asking you want me to read it out while you whilst you read the whilst you figure out the answer i'm going to just cover off a quick YouTube Apple TV question so that's great.

**[28:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1725s)** I've seen some YouTube videos where you talk about in pound VPNs using an Apple TV as an exit node and subnet router what is that all about well the general idea is that the Apple TV in my opinion is probably the best way

**[29:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1742s)** to put tail scale into a remote network that you don't have easy access to let's put it that way so like a parent's house maybe or a friend's house or somebody that.

**[29:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1753s)** You know you need an exit node in a different geolocation like for me it's quite handy to have an exit node in the UK for obvious reasons and I live in the States these days and so I just chuck an Apple TV under the stairs or figuratively at my parents house.

**[29:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1768s)** And it can act as both an exit node and a subnet router so an exit node lets me appear as if my traffic is exiting from that location where the Apple TV physically is so i'm far away but I want to appear as if i'm there that's what the exit node does and that's pretty common with typical privacy VPNs you know like Nord VPN and surf shark and all those guys that's typically how a VPN actually works is it scoops up all your traffic.

**[29:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1795s)** It puts it through a tunnel and spits it out through an exit location an exit node is just what we call it because you actually own the infrastructure which is.

**[30:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1802s)** A key difference between the kind of typical privacy VPN providers.

**[30:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1806s)** The subnet routing piece is a little more complicated and it can be very very handy actually for supporting friends and relatives remote network so subnet routing lets you access any device that can't natively or hasn't natively installed tail scale.

**[30:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1821s)** So any IP address is on that remote network if you enable subnet routing for the subnet range you can then access as if it was well ostensibly on your local land.

**[30:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1832s)** There are some caveats and things to watch out for and if you have like overlapping subnet ranges for example that can be a tricky one we would literally just published a blog post on four via six on our blog which I put a link to when I finished talking in the chat which will help you kind of avoid some of those pitfalls of overlapping subnet ranges.

**[30:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1850s)** But the reason I genuinely really love the Apple TV is that it doesn't use any power to do any of this it's one or two watts less less than one watt in standby.

**[31:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1860s)** And you still get all of these full this this full functionality even when it's in standby mode so there is no you know having to chuck your parents a tenor to cover the electric cost of putting a server under the stairs or something right I mean a half or what I mean nobody's going to notice that I don't think so.

**[31:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1879s)** That's why I love the Apple TV I mean if you're already in the Apple ecosystem it's it's great and you can if you put your Apple TV on your town that you can actually then stream media from a jelly fin server or whatever else anywhere else on your town it to boot and you get a free media player out to it on the other end so that's why I like the Apple TV so much.

**[31:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1899s)** Indeed I mean I've run one myself so I definitely agree just another quick one from the YouTube chat that I saw while I was reading Antony's question which is a lot more in depth.

**[31:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1912s)** Our account rep said we can use one TS account for our two use cases these being customer facing services employee VPN we'd like those on two separate accounts is there a way to do that are advisable yes.

**[32:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1922s)** If you saw at the beginning of when I was doing my show and tell there is now a way of doing this that is in private alpha Mike contact your account rep and ask for an additional tell me and we will take care of that for you.

**[32:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1933s)** So that's an easy love a low hanging fruit one okay so Antony's question I think I understand it I think so Antony is asking via zoom that he has a third party in my network that wants to extend that to their devices via tail scale.

**[32:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1950s)** I wanted to know if I could manage those devices is my own tail scale devices and provide them access to their devices while I control their access on what they see.

**[32:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1958s)** Traditionally I would have put one of them in behind my firewalls DMC but their product needs to be expanded through my enterprise network.

**[32:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1965s)** There's a few ways to solve this.

**[32:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1968s)** The easiest way if they're willing to authenticate their devices to your tail net is to just use ACLs to be able to actually segment the network that way.

**[32:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1977s)** If you want to maintain two separate networks then you can use no sharing to do that but there are some caveats with no sharing and if it's you if it's machine based users that you tag no sharing is not currently available for machine based users.

**[33:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=1994s)** So you can also authenticate them via SSO and then use ACLs again to actually segment what they can access.

**[33:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2002s)** I think to kind of give a more in depth answer Antony we should probably you should probably reach out to sales and we should have a more in depth conversation with that solution engineering team.

**[33:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2012s)** Similarly for these kind of more in depth questions with enterprise networks our solutions engineering team is is on hand to help you but I think we're probably going to be able to solve this with with ACLs and with like segmentate you can think about ACLs and like a more traditional networking model is like a layer to VLAN right like that's why I like to think of it.

**[33:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2031s)** You have to do I see if you they they are aware of each other on on like a network level but they can't communicate because there is logical separation between or so that's where the ACLs come in.

**[34:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2046s)** Simple as that huh ACLs everywhere yeah.

**[34:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2050s)** It's ACLs all the way down until it's grants of course and then indeed indeed yeah alright well thank you for taking that one that was a little complicated but I think we got there in the end.

**[34:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2062s)** So if I've turned on HTTPS certificates in my cabinet can I use the serve command to use TLS into a service running on a port using the tail scale address or do I need to run caddy alongside it or some other reverse proxy.

**[34:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2078s)** I think you probably don't know what this so I'm going to hand it over to you.

**[34:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2083s)** Yeah, tail scale serve just does the job I mean the caveat would be is that it's tricky to proxy more than one port for a node or a service.

**[34:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2092s)** So you're quite often see in the YouTube videos that I run one tail scale sidecar container alongside a specific service.

**[34:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2099s)** In fact we've got a video coming out about Kara keep today or tomorrow at some point I forget when I scheduled it for.

**[35:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2105s)** Where I'm using tail scale serve inside the Docker container to be the reverse proxy now if you want to just have one node be the reverse proxy you can run caddy of course you can absolutely do that's a valid pattern to do as well of course but.

**[35:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2118s)** If you just want a super simple way to put a service on your TS dot net domain with a TLS certificate there is no easier way than tail scale serve.

**[35:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2134s)** Okay question coming in is how reliable is tail scale might be a little biased but I use it all day every day in fact tail scale uses tail scale to build tail scale and we think it's we think it's alright.

**[35:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2146s)** Yeah, I absolutely agree in like it's completely the backbone of my connectivity but I think a good way to answer this is from a customer story and I can't remember if the customer allows us to talk about their logo so I'm just going to talk about the use case.

**[36:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2161s)** So we have at least one customer who deploys devices into rural parts of the USA in the farming industry and so they actually have tail scale on this IOT device and it's connected via a cell tower and they rely on tail scale to be able to push software updates and.

**[36:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2181s)** You know actually manage those devices over a cell phone connection and in a situation where it's actually solar powered so you can imagine and you know these devices will turn off on a regular basis so they'll run out of power tail scale the you know it gets more solar power it boots it comes back online and tail scale connects and that's how reliable that they've they found it to be because it will always be able to traverse the network that you're in and it will always allow you to get that connectivity so if one of the things you concerned about is.

**[36:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2210s)** You know I'm going to put something in a remote location I want to know that I can access it tail scale is almost certainly best bet in my opinion.

**[36:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2217s)** I actually use the node indicate the node indicators in the tail scale dashboard to almost be like an uptime dashboard for myself and I have lost VMs I have lost nodes physically on my network that showing that are showing their online in tail scale I'm like where are you I could ping you.

**[37:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2237s)** We need a tail scale locate I something like that where are you in the world yeah because the tail scale code as we talked about earlier is so good at finding ways out to you know be discovered as kind of the point of the natural stuff right.

**[37:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2254s)** It can it can find its way to ping home almost always when you think it even sometimes it shouldn't but.

**[37:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2262s)** There you go I see that largely as a positive and to build on what I said about tail scale is just tail scale to build tail scale is it's true like all of our CI systems are spread across different providers different infrastructures different architectures even and they're all connected on the back end together using tail scale we use it as part of our deployment process we use it as part of our.

**[38:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2283s)** In fact all of our internal documentation we have this little thing called go links so if I want to set up a new meeting with Lee for example I do go slash meat and it would create me a new meeting so that we've got.

**[38:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2293s)** Little services all over the tails of the town at internally the corporate town at and yeah I know I know we're horribly biased but we think it's we think it's an all right product.

**[38:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2304s)** Go links is just so useful for me like I just I like all I use it as a bookmarking tool right like it has all my bookmarks in it and I just do.

**[38:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2312s)** Go slash mail and it seems to me to my email right like it if you are running go links in your tell me you should really think about it it's really cool.

**[38:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2319s)** So many just posted in the chat tail scale air tags and now my brain is thinking what if we actually detected over like Bluetooth connections that would be so cool.

**[38:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2327s)** I think I know how to do that as well so now I'm interested.

**[38:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2331s)** So until next month will be yeah exactly another great question here from sovereign Sean will you ever be able to host an internal service to a public domain using an FQD and like image for example I think we've

**[39:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2344s)** found service before but it comes up on a regular basis do you want to have a take a stab at that I don't really going to do it again.

**[39:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2350s)** I have a video about this it's entitled self hosting services on a custom domain and the idea is you use caddy to proxy the service and but you use tail scale behind the scenes to actually connect.

**[39:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2363s)** The caddy front door to the back end service and then you can run the service wherever you like because image it the example here of course needed you to be fully effective for like machine learning for image for face detection that kind of thing.

**[39:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2377s)** So it's possible for you to distribute the various microservices that constituent constitutes sorry what what a self hosted app deployment might look like multiple boxes.

**[39:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2389s)** But then you still got your single front door single ingress point of caddy and then it does the proxy over tail scale behind the scenes and to you know to the user like they have no idea what's going on.

**[40:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2401s)** Yeah and like tail scale hands out IP addresses just hands out IP addresses from the carrier grade not space and so you can always just register that CG not in your own that CG not address that IP address in your domain manually it's relatively easy to do right like.

**[40:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2416s)** And then caddy handles all the proxy forwarding and all that kind of stuff so if you want to use your own domain that's the easiest way yeah.

**[40:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2422s)** Good deal I've got a Kubernetes question for you are you in the movie.

**[40:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2427s)** It's been a while Alex you know it's been a while.

**[40:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2430s)** Yeah let me find it I had it cute up here we go any support of a gateway API of Kubernetes on tail scale how does the ingress of tail scale work with Kubernetes and can we use a local dirt proxy all traffic to my clusters.

**[40:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2445s)** That sounds like a three part question so part one was are we planning on supporting the gateway API the answer to that is yes.

**[40:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2452s)** I don't know when that will be complete but it is on the road map and it is something that we will do for those who have what does that mean for those risk that don't know what a gateway API is.

**[41:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2462s)** So Kubernetes as a series of APIs that allow you to like do things like create a deployment or create a state full set and an ingress was the canonical way of getting you into a cluster.

**[41:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2473s)** And then something called an ingress controller would read those objects and then it basically is an ingress is a really fancy reverse proxy that is API driven right and so like.

**[41:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2483s)** If you imagine with caddy or something like that you update the host file and ingress basically manage that by an API.

**[41:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2491s)** As with all things software the people who built the ingress API then went oh we missed a whole bunch of stuff and so then they're building a second API which is called gateway API which is an enhancement on all the things that they don't want to shoe on into ingress so like.

**[41:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2505s)** You know they could have called it ingress me to they there is a whole bunch of reasons that I won't get into what I call in the gateway eight the calling gateway API so yes tell scale is planning to that the second part of the question was how does tail scale work with ingress.

**[41:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2519s)** So the tail scale Kubernetes operator also operates as an ingress controller and will in future act as a gateway API controller and what it does is it waits for an object that gets past the Kubernetes API of a type called ingress with an ingress class of tail scale and when it sees that it creates a tail scale device inside your Kubernetes cluster and then does a whole bunch of magic around tail scale serve and TCP forwarding to.

**[42:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2547s)** Allow you to be able to hit things in that Kubernetes cluster do that ingress object it's very clever it's very magic but you'll see when you actually create a tail scale ingress with the Kubernetes operator there's actually a device that shows up in your tail net called you know whatever the name of the ingress is.

**[42:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2565s)** And then the last part of that question was around dirt service because it's just a regular tail scale device you can absolutely use you absolutely use a dirt server to kind of funnel that to access any cluster.

**[42:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2578s)** I think what the question was around like access to cluster is do you want to be able to talk to the API of tells us of Kubernetes via tail scale will the operator has support for that virus off mode and so all those things are possible yes.

**[43:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2594s)** And all good things come to those who wait we all know that to be a universal truth as well.

**[43:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2599s)** It's really interesting because the Kubernetes operator is our fastest growing way of provisioning tail scale nodes and so.

**[43:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2607s)** You know the number of feature requests and we have on the operator side is absolutely remarkable and like the number of things that people want us to build is pretty remarkable.

**[43:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2616s)** And we have some really exciting stuff being announced about the corporate a corporate operator the Kubernetes operator in the next few weeks which I won't talk about but like there's a big announcement coming with an amazing feature that was recently kind of finished and kind of ready for for beta.

**[43:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2633s)** But you know the gateway APIs on the roadmap and obviously with it with the people moving towards it is the kind of canonical way of doing things we will certainly support that some point in the future yes.

**[44:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2643s)** The alpha beta to GA roadmap for the next six months is going to blow your socks off I think it's going to be pretty cool as a huge amount of stuff coming we've teased it on this stream a few times about you know stuff like a different you eyes for different parts of the products that you've all been waiting and asking for for a long time coming real soon we've seen it we were alpha testing it internally right now and it looks pretty sweet so yeah absolutely.

**[44:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2670s)** More to show you and more to share very soon on that topic I promise you.

**[44:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2675s)** Okay so what else we do now there's a bunch of questions in this doc and we've only got about 10 minutes left you want to pick one yeah I was like reading through them and like ready to declare bankruptcy there's so many questions but.

**[44:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2688s)** Yeah we just go through here on the zoom side no nothing here no you pick one I'm going to pick a proxmox question because I do love me some proxmox do it is it recommended or advised against to install tail scale on a proxmox node itself I keep coming across conflicting information on this.

**[45:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2708s)** Well I guess it kind of speaks to your philosophy on hypervisors for me I tend to treat my proxmox now is a little bit like just another server that can happen to run VMs and can happen to run LX is.

**[45:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2722s)** Proxmox is really cool because it can do ZFS out of the box which in the Linux world you know the licensing snafu's of plague ZFS forever.

**[45:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2734s)** Proxmox just runs a modified Ubuntu kernel and Debian user space so really it feels like Debian but under the covers like it's actually Ubuntu in a wool sheeps clothing.

**[45:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2746s)** It's also got the ability to you know migrate containers and VMs between different hosts so you can almost do live migration if you want to do clustering that kind of stuff it's just it's just a really nice thing to use and it's gained such adoption the last few years that there are there are really cool resources like helperscripts.com where you can.

**[46:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2766s)** Install one click apps effectively one click LXC's if you want to and like kind of stuff but coming back to your question should I install tail scale on the host or not.

**[46:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2777s)** I do because I like to be able to access the proxmox UI through tail scale simple as that I can use tail scale serve to proxy the the 8000 and 6 port on to my talent if I want to but equally it just means that I've got another sort of a different way to get to that front door if I want it.

**[46:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2796s)** Again I can put it in a caddy you know caddy file and have that proxy it or whatever but tells girls so lightweight uses I think at most like eight to I think I've seen some point use like 24 megabytes of memory which is a lot so I know but.

**[46:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2812s)** I think it's it's so lightweight it doesn't really matter you know and you can either run it as a container and pass it through the bits that it actually only ever needs to see.

**[47:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2821s)** Or you can just run it negatively on the host as a package and just get on with your life and have fun.

**[47:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2828s)** Yeah I love proxmox.

**[47:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2832s)** Question for you I like to see you an Android person or an iPhone person yes.

**[47:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2838s)** Do you know if tail scale app on Android spots being a subnet router.

**[47:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2844s)** I think so let me check I think it does too but I don't have any Android devices list is this is this is what you're all here for it's Alex getting his devices.

**[47:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2852s)** Out to check in real time this is this is what we're really for yeah just to prove I'm not sat in front of a green screen like that was actually my desk back.

**[47:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2860s)** Yeah I do love you set up in the background by the way I'm very jealous of it so looking forward to seeing all the stuff that you do in that office but.

**[47:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2869s)** Yeah this is a new office space that we've literally just finished building so subnet routing on Android subnet routing yes yes I can add a route to to the app on my phone if I want to.

**[48:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2882s)** So yes there you go Lewis not only did you get an answer to question you saw how unscripted this is in its finest form.

**[48:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2892s)** So yeah we have 10 minutes left I have a question for the chat and hopefully Natasha doesn't murder me for this I was going to ask her if she was located to ask about this but she's out of office.

**[48:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2904s)** We are having internal discussions about a meeting place for tail scale people lots of people visit the tail scale subreddit we really appreciate everyone's incredible commitment to our community on the tail scale side.

**[48:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2916s)** We've also recently started doing tail scale meet ups so if you want to have a tail scale meet up in your general location please let us know via our community and read it but we're having discussions about having something like a discord or a slack channel.

**[48:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2930s)** We haven't made a decision yet to be very very clear there's no decisions being made yet but we are interested if that is somewhere where people would like to congregate and hang out and the reason I'm asking this is because I'm noticing that the YouTube chat is now primarily people helping each other out which is incredible right like.

**[49:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2949s)** You know these people just answering questions on behalf of us so if you are interested in being part of a tail scale discord or something like that please let us know in the chat or in the YouTube comments after the video stream has ended.

**[49:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2965s)** Obviously and I see so many mentioning telegram as well you know we're open to ideas around which platform we use and so suggestions around which platform you would prefer to use as well I have a strong preference for discord personally but you know everybody everybody has their own preferences.

**[49:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2985s)** The downside to discord is that it's yet another proprietary chat app I mean whatever happened to IRC in the good old days huh.

**[49:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2994s)** I still hang out and I see a lot of people are still in there.

**[49:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=2997s)** Well three node kind of imploded and that was kind of the end of it really wasn't it and then Matrix came along in 80's lunch so you know maybe there's a world where we do a matrix server instead and it all becomes sort of open source type.

**[50:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3012s)** Staff instead of a discord because you know discord just took some funding not not to say that's necessarily a bad thing because tell us.

**[50:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3019s)** What are you doing Alex we already we address this last time.

**[50:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3023s)** But we all know that eventually you know it can be I've just I've seen rumors about discord and I've just not felt comfortable about their business model for a very long time.

**[50:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3034s)** It's different to how I feel about tailscales business model yes I know corporate shield blah blah blah but we'll see we'll see I think this could would be would be great.

**[50:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3044s)** I think for me that the the thing that you need to think about when you build these communities is where is everybody and like read it so successful because most people have a ready to count and I feel like discord is successful because regardless of you feeling about the platform.

**[50:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3055s)** Most people have a discord right like what's interesting on that topic is that for the last six years or so I've done a podcast called self hosted.

**[51:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3064s)** And we've had a discord server for the pretty much the duration of the show.

**[51:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3069s)** And many people in the world of self hosting feel very strongly that the self hosted podcast should have self hosted social media self hosted chat all the rest of it and my argument has always been.

**[51:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3079s)** Meet people where they are and further the mission don't worry too much about the minutia of like the perfect solution.

**[51:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3088s)** So here I am like eating my own dog food but there you go indeed we got a we got a question in.

**[51:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3094s)** So somebody asks maybe this is a meat issue and I love the self self reflection there but I had some issues with tail scale overriding and resolve.confile and those DNS went blackout.

**[51:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3106s)** I had to do some creative routing with DNS mass is that an issue without knowing what the DNS blackout was let's talk a little bit about how tail spell handles DNS.

**[51:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3117s)** So tail spell has a built in DNS server for your talent that which we call magic DNS which will allow you to resolve the host name of a tail scale client to its CG now IP address and the way that it does that is.

**[52:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3129s)** It actually every single tail scale client hosts a DNS resolver on the actual client which you can access over the quad 100 address which is like a special address that's in the talent.

**[52:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3144s)** If you have the setting use tail scale DNS settings when you start tail scale up it will override your DNS settings to use that particular quad 100.

**[52:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3155s)** Resolve or address you don't have to do that but if you want to resolve tail scales magic DNS names you will still be need to use something like DNS mask to forward to the quad 100 address for specific things.

**[52:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3167s)** I do have a configuration for DNS mask which is like a split DNS thing where if you look at a specific or if we do a look up for a specific tail net name or a TS dot met domain it will result to quad 100 and then everything else goes out through your through your standard DNS was over.

**[53:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3183s)** But this is entirely configurable you do not need to have it override and it's actually a client setting.

**[53:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3189s)** So the other thing that you can do a DNS is you can actually set global DNS forwarders across the whole tail net so for example if you want to resolve internal addresses in like a corporate environment you can actually have tail scale resolve on your behalf inside your network.

**[53:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3207s)** The thing that's always worth bearing in mind with those is that in order for them to work you do need to have an apple or an ACL that actually allows you to hit that tail scale DNS resolver.

**[53:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3215s)** So it's always worth making sure that you have all the like network path in there that you need.

**[53:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3220s)** So hopefully that helps and I think that probably takes us to time.

**[53:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3227s)** Pretty much but I've run into situations with DNS mask and resolve dot com where the host has been able to route packets to tail scale just find this is specifically a proxmox thing I think although it probably applies to many other container based situations.

**[54:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3244s)** And the LXC container inherits the hosts resolve dot com file because you didn't override or whatever you don't tell scale installed inside the LXC yet.

**[54:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3252s)** And you want to update a package or you want to do something like just to get that LXC out of the ground and suddenly it can't route packets because it's looking at the 100 dot name server and it can be a bit of a pain.

**[54:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3263s)** So just there's lots of gotchas lots of snaffos in that kind of area.

**[54:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3267s)** So yeah just yeah just just have fun with that one now when is our next webinar we had this posted in the chat at the top here I think it's June 4th there you go that's correct.

**[54:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3279s)** Yeah three weeks time or so.

**[54:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3281s)** Yeah.

**[54:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3282s)** 1 p.m. Eastern indeed we had a noticeable like drop off in questions today because this ever was so helpful in the chat.

**[54:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3290s)** Like people are able to help each other out which is exactly what I think we were hoping for when we were building this ask a tell scale expert.

**[54:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3299s)** But you know this is my favorite thing to do at tell scale so looking forward to to seeing you on the next one.

**[55:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3304s)** Yeah we still got a dozen or so more questions that we had time to get to today so again thank you all very much for contributing and being civil and lovely people.

**[55:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3313s)** We very much appreciate this and it is a highlight of our month here at tell scale so.

**[55:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3318s)** I think that will about do us for today so thank you very much and until next time I've been Alex.

**[55:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3324s)** I've been late.

**[55:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3325s)** And that's all for now.

**[55:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x_ySYZqRME&t=3327s)** I got you later.
