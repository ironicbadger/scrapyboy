# The Bookmark manager you didn't know you needed! Karakeep is the best way to hoard your digital life

**[00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=0s)** Now for anything like me, the old you get, the worse your memory gets, I swear. I know exactly

**[00:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=5s)** where I left my car keys. Yes, don't tell me they're in the last place I look. But in my

**[00:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=9s)** digital life, things, I don't know, there's just projects. I'm doing research for different

**[00:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=13s)** projects all the time, I go down different rabbit holes, and I think, wouldn't it be nice

**[00:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=17s)** if I could just somehow categorize all of these things related to self-hosting, or soldering

**[00:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=25s)** or woodworking, put them into buckets, and kind of find these webpages, and store them and

**[00:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=30s)** hoard them until the end of time. Well, that's where today's self-hosted app pick, Karakeep

**[00:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=36s)** comes in. This announces itself as the Bookmark Everything app. It allows you to quickly

**[00:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=42s)** save links and notes, but it has a few tricks up its sleeve. I know, don't click away, but

**[00:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=48s)** it's got some AI juice under the hood, which will automatically add tags to your notes

**[00:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=53s)** as well as allowing you to summarise massively long webpages as well. And in this digital

**[00:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=58s)** age where so much of our information kind of suffers from this, I don't want to say

**[01:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=63s)** bit rot, but maybe you know what I mean when I say that, it kind of just has this entropy

**[01:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=67s)** of dead links and things just don't seem to stick around for as long as they're used to.

**[01:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=73s)** Well, with Karakeep, it will take a snapshot of the webpages, both a screenshot and a text

**[01:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=77s)** searchable transcript of the page as well. So let me show you a couple of things in action

**[01:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=83s)** here. So here is a couple of links I've hoarded. In fact, later on in the video, I'm going

**[01:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=87s)** to walk you through the process of installing Karakeep. But for now, here's a really quick

**[01:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=91s)** demo before we get into the nitty-gritty later on. Now, if I click on this button here,

**[01:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=95s)** you can see there's a few options. I've got an actual, it takes a, just a screenshot of

**[01:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=99s)** the page. So on this day in history, this is exactly what this website looked like. Isn't

**[01:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=105s)** that cool? And on top of that, I can click on this button, which will take me to the original

**[01:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=110s)** page. I can look at it. I can say summarize with AI. And this is using an open AI API token.

**[01:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=117s)** So far, I've only spent about 50 cents. And I've been using this thing for about three months

**[02:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=121s)** in my personal life. So you know, it's not free to use open API, but it's not too terribly

**[02:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=128s)** expensive either. And you can see rather than maybe having to search through and skimmy

**[02:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=132s)** this whole page, I can now just look at this little AI generated summary. These tags

**[02:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=137s)** were also AI generated automatically when I hoarded the web page. So let's show you,

**[02:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=142s)** let's do something in like tail scale, how tail scale works. Tail scale out works. Tails

**[02:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=148s)** go how it works. Okay, cool. Now, if I click on this button up here, I've added a Chrome

**[02:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=152s)** extension to my browser session, which again, we cover towards the end of the video. And

**[02:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=156s)** this allows me to hoard this web page inside of Karakeep. And you can see I'm just going

**[02:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=161s)** to do like no user intervention. It's figured out what the tags are for this specific video.

**[02:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=167s)** So VPN, mesh network, wire guard, tail scale, network security. That looks good to me. But

**[02:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=172s)** I can also add lists and things like that. So in Karakeep itself, I can go in and create

**[02:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=177s)** a list somewhere. Here we go. And I'm going to call this one, I don't know, networking education.

**[03:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=185s)** Create that. And I want to now add this article to a list by clicking on the three dot menu

**[03:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=189s)** and manage lists. This will be available now anytime that I want to add and I'll clip

**[03:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=194s)** a new bookmark or whatever. I'm going to add that on here. But maybe you noticed in that

**[03:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=199s)** drop down as a few other interesting options. And one of them is download a full page archive.

**[03:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=206s)** So this is really allowing you to download all the assets that the web page has any images.

**[03:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=211s)** And really just prevent that kind of link decay. That's probably the correct way to say

**[03:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=216s)** link decay that happens across the internet these days, sadly. So for me, this is exactly

**[03:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=221s)** what self hosting is all about finding a problem in your digital life and finding a self hosted

**[03:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=226s)** service to fix it. So let's dig into how we actually deploy Karakeep. And, well, I nearly

**[03:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=232s)** called it hoarder. They used this project used to be called hoarder a few months ago,

**[03:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=237s)** but there was some kind of a trademark dispute and some kind of a patent troll that kind

**[04:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=241s)** of thing. And unfortunately, the project succumbed to it and had to rename itself Karakeep.

**[04:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=245s)** So if you find any references in the app to hoarding or anything like that, that's why

**[04:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=250s)** they're there is because the project was originally called hoarder, which was a better name

**[04:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=253s)** and unfortunately, but such is life sometimes. So let's dig into how we actually go ahead now

**[04:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=259s)** and deploy Karakeep. So let's move on to the deployment section of this video. By now,

**[04:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=266s)** you probably know I'm going to be using Docker to do this. So I put a link in the description

**[04:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=270s)** to a GitHub repo where I have a bunch of code snippets for all of these videos. And today's

**[04:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=276s)** video is no different talking about Karakeep, of course. So in this VS code window right here,

**[04:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=282s)** I have a Docker compose file that's going to outline the deployment of Karakeep for us.

**[04:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=287s)** There's a few containers to look at. First of all, we've got this Karakeep TS container.

**[04:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=292s)** And this is what's going to put the Karakeep app onto your tailnet. We're then going to link

**[04:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=298s)** the Karakeep app itself to tailscale using this line here, network mode. So in terms of deploying

**[05:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=306s)** the tailscale portion, that's already taken care of now. So the Karakeep app itself,

**[05:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=311s)** there's three containers involved here. There's the main application itself. Then there is a

**[05:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=318s)** containerized version of Google Chrome. This is pretty interesting. And this is how Karakeep actually

**[05:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=323s)** does the scraping. So what it does is it looks at a web page and it goes, well, I need to load this

**[05:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=328s)** up in a fake browser and then scrape the content that way. And then Miele, Miele, Miele search.

**[05:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=338s)** I don't know how to say this one. This one is what you use to actually, it's kind of like a very,

**[05:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=344s)** it's nothing like elastic search, but it's a very lightweight version of a search,

**[05:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=348s)** like a local search engine that you can use to search through all your bookmarks and all the

**[05:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=352s)** content that Karakeep has hoarded for you. So there were a few things to look at in here that we

**[05:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=356s)** need to be aware of. Now, the official project documentation recommends that you put these things

**[06:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=361s)** in a .n file separately from your Docker compose file. However, personally, I always prefer to keep

**[06:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=366s)** things declarative and just keep them all, you know, all the configuration required to make the

**[06:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=371s)** application run, keep it alongside the application, not a separate file. You can choose to use an

**[06:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=376s)** n file if you prefer, but this is the route I'm going to go today. Now, we need to do a few things

**[06:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=381s)** here. We need to make sure that we've got all of these addresses correct. You can see that I've got

**[06:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=385s)** HTTP. Well, but basically, we're going to go through the environment variables, right? And I'm not

**[06:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=390s)** going to go through each line line by line, but you are going to have to make sure that all of these

**[06:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=394s)** things match. So Karakeep hyphen, Miley, nearly search, the browser web URL needs to match the name.

**[06:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=404s)** So that's what this needs to match here is this line here. In fact, let's just add a couple of lines

**[06:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=409s)** to our definition further down here. Just so that everything is definitely going to be named

**[06:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=415s)** exactly what we want to, you know, explicit and being declarative and all that. So contain the name

**[07:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=421s)** Karakeep, Miley search. Okay, cool. Now, we need to configure a couple of the secrets in here. So

**[07:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=428s)** the next auth secret, and there is some information over on the project's documentation on exactly how

**[07:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=434s)** to generate that. You can see here using open SSL Rand blah, blah, blah. So if I just copy that into

**[07:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=440s)** a terminal window right here, it's going to generate me a random string, which I can just copy and paste

**[07:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=447s)** into my secret right here. And now that's taken care of. Now we want to next look for the master key,

**[07:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=455s)** which is another random string, which I assume we can generate in the same way. If we can't, then

**[07:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=460s)** we're about to find out, but let's just do that for now. Okay, here we go. Let's paste that in here.

**[07:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=466s)** Okay, so we've got our two secrets. We've got our secret here. We've got our master key, but

**[07:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=471s)** what you might notice is further down in the Miley search container. The master key is also

**[07:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=478s)** specified here too. So make sure you update that in both places. And this could be a good reason to

**[08:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=483s)** use a dot end file, rather than having things in the files, you know, alongside. If you're using

**[08:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=488s)** the dot end file, these values get presented as environment variables to the container when they

**[08:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=494s)** get spun up. So you don't need to update it in multiple places, but I don't know, I guess personal

**[08:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=500s)** preference. Let's just leave it at that. Now next door, you are all needs to point to the server's

**[08:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=505s)** address. And of course, we're going to be using tailscale for this. And it's going to be running on

**[08:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=509s)** carakeep.volosa wraps a high for noodle fish dot TS dot net. So how do we find that stuff out? So

**[08:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=515s)** if we get a tailscale.com and go to your admin console, get signed in. Of course, you know,

**[08:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=521s)** probably see me do this a hundred times on the channel, but, you know, you just get signed into

**[08:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=525s)** tailnet. Once you're there, you want to look for the DNS tab at the top of the page. And then

**[08:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=530s)** there is your tailnet name right there. You can rename it. So your default tailnet name will be

**[08:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=534s)** something that looks a little bit like this. You can reroll your name to have something that has

**[08:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=539s)** you know, a tail or something that has scales. You also want to make sure that you've got magic

**[09:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=545s)** DNS turned on and HTTPS certificates turned on in your tailscale have been consoled too.

**[09:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=551s)** And so that's how you get the address. So you know that now that your tailnet name is

**[09:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=555s)** volosa wraps a high for noodle fish dot TS dot net. But in terms of getting the first part of it,

**[09:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=561s)** we've got to make sure that this host name variable here is set to whatever you wanted to be. You

**[09:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=565s)** can say, order, you could say keep, you could say bookmarks, whatever you want to call it,

**[09:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=571s)** those things just need to match. Okay, so that's the next URL taken care of this data directory.

**[09:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=576s)** Just don't touch it. Leave it a slash data. We can see we've specified that as a volume up here.

**[09:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=581s)** That's where all of the data for Karakeep is going to persist. And then there are some crawler

**[09:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=586s)** environment variables I've specified here to store screenshots and that kind of stuff. Nothing

**[09:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=590s)** too crazy. Now, if you want to specify an open AI API key in order for some of the automated

**[09:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=596s)** tagging and summarization and stuff like that to work, this is where you would specify that. So

**[10:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=602s)** if you want to head over to platform dot open AI dot com API keys, this is totally optional.

**[10:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=609s)** Karakeep will work just fine without an API key, but you won't get some of the automated tagging

**[10:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=614s)** and some of the smarts. I do believe that Karakeep will also work with Olam and some of the other

**[10:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=619s)** sort of more self-hosted options. But I don't know. I'm just going to show you how to do open API

**[10:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=624s)** today. So I'm just going to call this Karakeep TS and then just create a secret key right here.

**[10:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=631s)** I'm going to remember to revoke that before the video goes live, of course. I'm going to uncomment this

**[10:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=637s)** and then just put my API key in there like that. And we should be good to go now. We should be

**[10:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=643s)** able to now deploy this software. So we're going to need somewhere to run it and I have a virtual

**[10:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=648s)** machine set up in Proxmox today. So here in the first tab, I have a VM, you know, Karakeep VM.

**[10:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=655s)** This is just running on 10.42.782. That's the IP address of this virtual machine. And I am SSH

**[11:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=663s)** into this system. So SSH is a way to remotely access a system from, well, in my case, my laptop.

**[11:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=671s)** So this virtual machine is running on a server where it's actually just out of shot just down there

**[11:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=676s)** in the darkness. You can't see it. But this virtual machine is running on that box over there.

**[11:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=681s)** And I don't want to have to, I can't even physically go and connect a keyboard and mouse to it because

**[11:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=685s)** I'm not it's a virtual machine. It doesn't have a physical interface like that.

**[11:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=689s)** So when I want to administer that machine, I need to use a secure shell to get a shell prompt

**[11:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=695s)** to actually do anything with it. So that's what SSH does. And I can use this as a FOD user,

**[11:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=699s)** which is a user that is created inside that virtual machine, type in my password. And suddenly,

**[11:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=705s)** I could interact with that virtual machine as if I was, well, ostensibly physically present on it.

**[11:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=710s)** So that I can do a Docker, actually, the ZFOD user isn't in the Docker group. I need to be pseudo

**[11:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=715s)** in this case into my pseudo password. And I can see there are no containers on this box.

**[12:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=722s)** So if you decide for some reason you want to put your user into the Docker group so you don't have

**[12:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=726s)** to type pseudo every time you want to use Docker, you can do pseudo user mod minus OG. I think it's

**[12:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=734s)** I think it's this. It could be the other way around. And now I can do ID. Did I get it the right

**[12:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=740s)** way around? No, I always get this one wrong. ZFOD Docker. Oh, no, I did get it right. Okay, cool.

**[12:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=747s)** I'm going to log out and log back in again. And I'm in the Docker group. Yes, I am. So now,

**[12:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=755s)** now I can do Docker PS without doing pseudo. So again, that was just user mod minus a capital G to add

**[12:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=764s)** to a group. And then ZFOD Docker. All right, I digress a little bit there. Sorry about that.

**[12:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=770s)** But tail scale is installed on this machine. And this is a really straightforward process to do.

**[12:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=775s)** You can head over to tailscale.com slash download and go to our Linux option and then just paste

**[13:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=783s)** in this script. And this is going to allow you to install tail scale on pretty much any system.

**[13:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=788s)** It'll download the install script and do all the rest of it. But you know, I've already done that.

**[13:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=792s)** Tailscales are already installed here. But if you need to install tailscale on the host and you

**[13:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=796s)** don't necessarily need to, but I like to for the following reason, we are going to have to copy

**[13:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=803s)** this Docker compose file from our laptop to the remote system. And I like to do that using the

**[13:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=809s)** tailscale VS code extension over here on the left. You can go to the VS code extensions option

**[13:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=815s)** here and just search for tailscale and install that this way. And then that will show up on the left

**[13:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=820s)** here. And it will pick up the authentication you've got in your operating system client and pass

**[13:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=826s)** that through to the code. And it will scan for nodes on your tailnet. You can then modify files on

**[13:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=831s)** those nodes directly from the code. And it's just really, really simple. So what I want to do right now

**[13:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=837s)** is do a pseudo tailscale up minus minus SSH type in my pseudo password and connect this node to our

**[14:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=846s)** tailnet. So I'm going to get this URL which I'm going to command click on and then click on sign

**[14:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=852s)** in with Google. And once that's done, we should have the Karakeep VM on our tailnet. And I need to

**[14:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=859s)** select the tailnet because I'm member of a couple with this account, visit the console. And here

**[14:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=864s)** we go. We've now got Karakeep as a virtual machine as like the host for Karakeep. This is

**[14:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=870s)** this is now on our tailnet and we can do tailnet status just to verify that on the host. And then

**[14:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=875s)** if you go back to VS code, we should see that we've now got Karakeep VM indeed as an option.

**[14:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=879s)** So before you click on the VM, you want to right click and do change SSH username. And I want to set

**[14:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=885s)** mine to zafod. You can of course set this to whatever you want to be. And sometimes it will match

**[14:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=890s)** the laptop you're connecting from and it will all just kind of work. But in this scenario, we want

**[14:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=895s)** to do zafod. Okay. So now if I click on this drop down option here, you can see I can modify files

**[15:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=902s)** in the directory of the remote virtual machine. I've got a file explorer. I've got a terminal

**[15:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=907s)** option here. So if I click that button there, you can see I've now opened in the home directory of

**[15:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=911s)** zafod. And there's currently nothing there. So I'm going to do make containers. Why not? And then

**[15:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=918s)** if I click the refresh button, you'll see that directory now appears. And I can do new file.

**[15:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=923s)** I can do compose.yaml and double click that. And now I can edit these two files side by side.

**[15:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=930s)** On this side, I can have the one on the remote machine. And this one, I can have the one on my local

**[15:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=935s)** laptop. So I'm going to copy and paste that between the two and then change into the containers

**[15:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=940s)** directory. And then we can just try and run this thing. But I think that we've got one more thing

**[15:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=944s)** to fix before we go ahead and try and do that. We need to get ourselves an auth key. And so this

**[15:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=949s)** is going to allow us to authorize this application onto our tablet. So head over to settings.

**[15:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=954s)** Go to keys over at tell scale.com generates an auth key. And I'm just going to call this one

**[15:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=958s)** carekeep. I'm going to be reusable because I'm doing a demo. You can leave all of this stuff

**[16:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=963s)** completely stock. I'm going to copy this onto my clipboard and then paste this in here.

**[16:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=969s)** And we should now actually be good to go. So I'm going to copy this onto the remote system.

**[16:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=976s)** Press save. And now I'm going to do a docker compose pull, which will pull all of those

**[16:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=981s)** containers down. And then once that's done, we can do a docker compose up minus D. And it's

**[16:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=987s)** going to start those containers for us. So let's jump back to our primary shell for this node.

**[16:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=992s)** Jump into the containers directory and then do a docker compose logs minus F. And just see if

**[16:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=998s)** there's anything kind of funky kind of weird going on. Don't see anything right now. So hopefully

**[16:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1003s)** that's a good sign. Now we can check that carekeep as the app was added to our talent right here.

**[16:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1009s)** Okay, we can see that that's that's a really good sign. Now if we go to this drop down menu here,

**[16:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1015s)** we can get the entire host name, the entire sort of fully qualified domain name for this service.

**[17:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1020s)** And then we're going to want to do HTTPS carekeep dot whatever. But of course, it's not going to work

**[17:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1025s)** right now because on this occasion, we didn't specify anything to do with tailscale serve.

**[17:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1031s)** And tailscale serve is the way that we it's basically a reverse proxy built into tailscale that

**[17:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1035s)** you can use for any service on your tailnet. So what I want to do is do a control seat come out

**[17:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1040s)** of this. And then I'm going to do something a little weird. I haven't done this on the channel

**[17:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1044s)** before. And it's something that I it was experimenting around with one of our engineers the other

**[17:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1048s)** day. And I was like, why don't you just do it this way? And I'm like, oh yeah. Okay, so we can do docker

**[17:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1054s)** exec minus IT find the name of the container that we want to execute inside of which is actually

**[17:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1059s)** going to be containers carekeep TS1. And then we're going to do tailscale serve what port number?

**[17:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1067s)** What port number does carekeep use? And then by default, I think that carekeep uses port 3000.

**[17:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1075s)** So we'll try that to start with. So essentially what we're doing is tailscale serve dash dash

**[17:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1079s)** BG 3000. And you can see that we're now proxying port 3000 from inside your tailscale carekeep container

**[18:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1088s)** to port basically port 443 on your tailnet. And it will be accessible at this URL. So let's head

**[18:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1094s)** over here now and refresh the page and see that this is now reaching out to Acme and set DNS to do

**[18:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1099s)** a whole bunch of stuff to basically put this thing on my tailnet with a proper TLS certificate.

**[18:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1105s)** No messing about with reverse proxies. This is now on my tailnet. So I'm going to sign up as ZFOD.

**[18:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1110s)** I'm going to call myself ZFOD at or why not tailscale.com and then create a password. Here we go.

**[18:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1116s)** Sign up. And there we go. We are now using carekeep. So let's go and clip our first item.

**[18:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1122s)** I don't know. Let's do Wikipedia TCP IP. So thrilling, thrilling article to kind of hoard right here.

**[18:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1131s)** But essentially, you can just paste that and save that into carekeep and it will now be in there

**[18:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1136s)** forever. And you can search this thing as well. If you want to, you can look. So let's find a

**[19:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1141s)** weird. Let's find a really random word. Internet working protocol. Okay, that's a very strange word.

**[19:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1147s)** Let's do internet working. So you can literally search the entire contents of these articles

**[19:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1153s)** in the search box up here. You can also configure carekeep chrome extension

**[19:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1160s)** to work directly with carekeep itself. So you don't have to copy and paste links kind of manually

**[19:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1165s)** around. We can add this extension to our Chrome session. I believe there's one for Firefox as well.

**[19:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1171s)** If that's more your flavor. And then we want to put in the server address of, well, I'm not going to

**[19:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1175s)** type that out because it's quite long. I'm going to put this on my clipboard. And then,

**[19:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1183s)** where did it go? Let's pin that one up here for now. Click on here. Paste that into here,

**[19:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1188s)** configure. And I'm going to go and get myself an API key. Sure. Why not? Let's go into user settings

**[19:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1194s)** and then API keys on the left hand side. Generate a new API key of Chrome laptop. Create that one.

**[20:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1202s)** Copy that to my clipboard. Paste that into the extension. Configure API key. Log in with API key.

**[20:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1208s)** And now when I go to a random website, so let's look for Pangolin Anatomy. One of randoms

**[20:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1218s)** at a Google searches I do for this channel. Let's go to Britannica rather than Wikipedia.

**[20:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1222s)** So you get a different idea of what's going on. I can now just click on this button. And you

**[20:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1226s)** can see that we're going to reach out to OpenAI. And it's going to do some tagging for us already.

**[20:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1231s)** So let's just check that's actually working. Well, there you go. You can see it's already added

**[20:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1235s)** through AI. It's already added the tags to this thing. So I can now search in my, in my,

**[20:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1239s)** I need it called it hoarder. In my carekeep instance, I can, I can summarize the article with AI,

**[20:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1245s)** I can look for tags, I can do a whole bunch of stuff. But again, I can search for Pangolin.

**[20:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1251s)** You see, it's really fast. Like, I mean, literally, if I type the word PA, you can see PAN

**[20:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1256s)** and it disappears immediately like that. So there's a pretty quick overview of what you can do with

**[21:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1262s)** carekeep. There is probably more to it than that. I mean, you can plug this into an OIDC provider

**[21:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1268s)** as well. If you'd like to, in fact, the genesis for the video with OIDC and Pocket ID a couple of

**[21:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1273s)** weeks ago was me messing about with this and trying to get it working with OIDC. So just to keep

**[21:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1279s)** this video a reasonable length, I'm not going to do that today. But I will put a link to my personal

**[21:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1284s)** GitHub repo in the description down below where there's, it's really just a few environment variables

**[21:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1288s)** you can figure for carekeep to plug it into Pocket ID. So I think that will do us for today. And

**[21:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1294s)** until next time, I want to say a great big thank you to everybody that's watched right

**[21:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cCC3PSBCkqk&t=1298s)** way to the end. I've been Alex from tailscale.
