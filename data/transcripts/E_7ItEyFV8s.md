# Tailscale Release Recap for October 2023

**[00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=E_7ItEyFV8s&t=0s)** Here's the Tailscale release recap for October. With the recent release of TVOS 17 adding VPN support, you can now add your Apple TV directly to your tailnet. We've added the ability to use the Apple TV as an exit node on your tailnet. This means you can route any traffic from anywhere in your tailnet and send it as if it's coming out of the Apple TV itself. An always on low-power device of the Apple TV makes the perfect exit node for a friend or relative sense. And we didn't stop there. We've partnered with Mulvad to make its global network of VPN servers

**[00:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=E_7ItEyFV8s&t=30s)** available to our customers. You can now easily browse the web using any one of Mulvad's available servers as a Tailscale exit node, while maintaining the user privacy that's synonymous with Mulvad. Check out our blog at tailscale.com to learn more.
