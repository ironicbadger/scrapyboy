# Ask a Tailscale Expert

**[00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=0s)** Three, two, one. Hello. Welcome. There we go. We're live. Welcome into another Tailscale,

**[00:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=6s)** ask the experts live stream with me. My name is Alex. Hello. I'm Lee. We were doing a two

**[00:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=13s)** runny's a little bit there. I wonder if half of our audience are going to know who the two

**[00:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=20s)** runny's are either there. Yeah. Below the age threshold, outside the country threshold.

**[00:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=26s)** I made a reference to a contractor that's been doing some work on my house this week about somebody

**[00:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=31s)** being a jobsworth. That does not translate. No, it's not a good, it's not a, we should just call this

**[00:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=37s)** the Tailscale British expatriate hour at this point, I think, right? Like, exactly.

**[00:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=43s)** Two British people live in America. Right, exactly. Yeah. Jobs are sort of a word. I use that all the time

**[00:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=49s)** and I just see the blank stare of people with that use that word. I'm like, what does that mean, exactly?

**[00:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=53s)** Yeah, it's got nothing to do with the word. That's just how people react to your beauty.

**[00:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=58s)** So what have you been up to? You've been hacking on any more Tailscale related projects.

**[01:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=62s)** We had a good look at stunner last time. What else you've been working on?

**[01:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=65s)** No, no show and tell this week. I think we have lots of show and tell on the tailscale work though.

**[01:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=70s)** We go, we launched the community projects today, which I'm really excited about.

**[01:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=75s)** So I'm really great stuff that you've done videos on like TSIDP, which is I think you have used on your proxmox setup for a little while.

**[01:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=84s)** I think that's really awesome. And then, you know, for whatever I've been up to and lots of travel.

**[01:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=90s)** We've got a cute con next week. How about you? What have you been up to?

**[01:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=94s)** I love the video about the behind the scenes, by the way. That was awesome.

**[01:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=97s)** Oh, yeah. I'm glad you liked it. We had a comment just now in the YouTube chat as well.

**[01:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=102s)** If you want to ask us questions, that's kind of the entire purpose of this next hour is any tailscale questions you have.

**[01:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=109s)** Throw them in the YouTube live chat. We've also got a Zoom live chat as well.

**[01:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=112s)** If you're over there instead, we'll do our best to pick them up.

**[01:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=115s)** But yeah, I've been moving, I'm moving house, but I've been moving studios in my new space.

**[02:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=120s)** The attic is finally, wait, it's complete enough to do a live stream.

**[02:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=124s)** I'm hearing a lot of room tone through my headphones right now, which I need to put some acoustic panels up.

**[02:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=130s)** You look a lovely natural light behind you though, which it is nice to have, isn't it, right?

**[02:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=135s)** Yeah, no, I need a blind on that because it's a little overexposed, you know.

**[02:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=139s)** Yeah, we need to figure that out, but you know, literally the builder handed me the keys about an hour ago.

**[02:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=146s)** So so to speak. So it's been, I'm a little flushed.

**[02:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=149s)** Well, you got one and straight into a live stream as well. That's the way to do it.

**[02:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=153s)** I think like testing live in production is there.

**[02:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=157s)** And just back to the questions thing.

**[02:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=159s)** If we don't get questions, it's just going to be me and Alex talking about 80s British shows.

**[02:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=163s)** So you definitely should ask questions if you want to hear us not talk about our millennial experience.

**[02:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=170s)** Yeah.

**[02:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=171s)** Yeah. So let's focus just for a few minutes on this new community projects thing that launched today.

**[02:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=176s)** So I put it, just put a link in the YouTube live chat.

**[02:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=178s)** This is a new initiative from tail scale where we want to highlight all of the amazing contributions that you are wonderful community.

**[03:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=186s)** Make by using tail scale and furthering, you know, tail scale adoption in the community.

**[03:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=192s)** So there's a bunch of really cool projects over here.

**[03:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=194s)** We've created a new kind of like landing page dashboard and has a bunch of stuff over there.

**[03:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=199s)** You mentioned TSI D.P.

**[03:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=201s)** But there's some other really cool stuff in there like the home assistant integration.

**[03:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=204s)** There's even a raycast extension. Are you a raycast guy?

**[03:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=207s)** I'm not. I haven't been able to get on a home lab up and running.

**[03:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=211s)** But I'm really excited to start digging into some of this stuff.

**[03:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=214s)** So no, not yet. I will say not yet.

**[03:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=216s)** Yeah. Okay. Good deal.

**[03:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=218s)** Well, there's a bunch of cool stuff over there.

**[03:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=220s)** So please go check it out.

**[03:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=221s)** Tesco.com slash community slash community hyphen projects.

**[03:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=225s)** Yeah. So I put a link to that in the live chat as well.

**[03:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=228s)** Raycast by the way is like, you know, on the macOS thing, you've got spotlight where you can search for stuff.

**[03:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=233s)** Raycast is like that, but turned up to 11.

**[03:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=236s)** Oh, I completely missed that.

**[03:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=238s)** I thought I raycast was some home lab thing. No, I used to use Alfred for a long time.

**[04:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=243s)** Is that an enhancement on Alfred? Yeah, yeah.

**[04:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=247s)** Just like Alfred, but honestly, better.

**[04:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=250s)** So we're starting to get some bottler here.

**[04:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=253s)** We're starting to get some questions coming through.

**[04:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=256s)** So let's pick up the first one here from Z sparks.

**[04:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=260s)** I hope I said that correctly.

**[04:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=262s)** Can you help me understand how to set up subnet routers for devices that I can't use the app on.

**[04:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=268s)** For some reason, I'm struggling to understand.

**[04:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=270s)** Yeah.

**[04:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=272s)** So tail scale works best when you can install tail scale directly on the thing that you want to connect to.

**[04:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=280s)** And if you have an operating system that you can access, that's really easy to do.

**[04:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=283s)** You just log into it via windows or via ssh or whatever other mechanism.

**[04:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=288s)** And then you install tail scale and everything is good with the world.

**[04:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=292s)** A subnet router is a mechanism that you can use to access devices over the tail scale network.

**[04:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=299s)** If you can't install tail scale or you don't want to install tail scale on every single devices in your network.

**[05:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=306s)** So if we take the example of your home network, you have a router that sat in a closet somewhere or underneath TV that is responsible for giving you Wi-Fi access.

**[05:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=320s)** It also has a DHCP server built in to hand out IP addresses.

**[05:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=324s)** It often has a little bit DNS server in there.

**[05:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=328s)** And so if you install tail scale inside your home network and set up a subnet router that advertises the same range.

**[05:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=337s)** As your home router advertises, you'll be able to access everything that's on that network, including your smart TV or your security cameras or your media collection.

**[05:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=349s)** So, you know, we have some really great documentation of subnet routers.

**[05:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=352s)** I think the things that you really need to be able to know before you do that is, what is the address range that your home, your home router is advertising.

**[06:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=361s)** It's usually a 192.168 slash 24 in my experience.

**[06:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=367s)** It might be a dot or zero dot one dot two or something along those lines.

**[06:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=371s)** And then you just need to install it on something like a box.

**[06:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=374s)** It's in your house. It's always on like your Apple TV and the rest should work pretty straightforwardly.

**[06:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=379s)** Anything you're mad to that Alex.

**[06:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=381s)** Yeah, I think so it's easy when you're coming in.

**[06:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=385s)** So there are two ways traffic can flow into an out of a network.

**[06:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=388s)** Right, you've got typically with a subnet router, the idea is you plop it into a subnet and then you can access everything kind of behind that subnet router.

**[06:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=396s)** Almost like a firewall in some kind of way.

**[06:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=399s)** But I'm just going to drop a link in the YouTube chat here in case the question was asking about going the other way for non tail scale capable devices.

**[06:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=407s)** So how do they route packets over the tailnet when they're not on the town at themselves.

**[06:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=412s)** And it basically comes down to a bunch of forwarding rules that you've got to configure.

**[06:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=418s)** And there's a link from a good friend of mine called Matt Knight, which I've just put a link to in the chat.

**[07:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=422s)** And he wrote a post on how he uses this functionality to connect to Roku to his tailnet for his parents.

**[07:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=429s)** And that is what allows the packets from his parents remote network.

**[07:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=433s)** And the Roku, I don't think runs tail scale, unfortunately, pretty much everything else does.

**[07:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=437s)** But Roku unfortunately does not.

**[07:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=440s)** And so the idea is is that you have to set up the IP tables rules and configure the essentially essentially give the Roku in this case.

**[07:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=449s)** Knowledge of where to send the packet so that they have a correct translation of the NAT stuff that goes on and then they fly over the tailnet that way and give them kind of the correct default gateway.

**[07:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=460s)** Hopefully that answers the question.

**[07:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=464s)** It could be a tricky one, though, and that that's kind of why we recommend installing tail scale natively on as many devices as possible because then you just don't have to worry about that stuff.

**[07:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=473s)** Makes your life a lot easier. Yeah, exactly.

**[07:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=476s)** Okay, good deal. So I think that might cover off the subnet route to one.

**[08:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=481s)** Okay, we had a good question in the zoom chat for Steve Wiggins, which I want to kind of address.

**[08:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=489s)** So the question is, do you have any guidance on how to reduce latency when using a subnet router hosted on AWS?

**[08:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=496s)** Are there any options to support a best global accelerator?

**[08:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=501s)** And I'm going to answer my own question here because there's one of my projects that I've been working on while I've been at tail scale.

**[08:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=507s)** Latency within tail scale connections is indicated by the connection type.

**[08:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=512s)** I'm hopeful that most people understand the difference between relayed and direct connection at this point.

**[08:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=519s)** I think it's something that we've rehashed several times if you don't feel like you know what what that is just coming in one of the respective chats and we can kind of rehash it.

**[08:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=528s)** The problem with AWS is that anything that is behind in AWS Manage Nat Gateway is probably going to get relay connections.

**[08:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=538s)** And the reason for that is that AWS Manage Nat Gateway is due port port and IP dependent mapping.

**[09:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=543s)** So every single outbound connection gets a new port assigned to it.

**[09:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=547s)** It's really hard to for tail scale to reuse that port for direct connections.

**[09:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=551s)** There is a webinar that I did what must be seven months or eight months ago now, which was titled

**[09:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=561s)** not traversal explain or like tail scale direct connect connectivity demystified or something along those lines.

**[09:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=568s)** Hopefully our trusty 10 can fish it out.

**[09:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=571s)** There is an experimental option in the tail scale client where you can use an AWS load balancer or a best global accelerator in front of tail scale with an environment variable.

**[09:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=580s)** It is not officially supported just yet. So your mileage may vary.

**[09:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=585s)** But it is a it is an option for you to be able to put global accelerator or a load balancer in front of tail scale and get direct connections.

**[09:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=594s)** So I highly recommend taking a look at that as an option.

**[09:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=599s)** It is my my the AWS Manage Nat Gateway is my biggest enemy at tail scale right now.

**[10:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=606s)** So I am actively working with the AWS team just see what we can do about that.

**[10:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=613s)** Yeah, it's worth calling out at this point. I think that we have a direct partnership with AWS.

**[10:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=619s)** And our engineering teams are always working with them to try and optimize things because as Lee was talking about some of the port optimizations and things.

**[10:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=628s)** Because of the nature of AWS's network being so complicated and so flexible really.

**[10:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=635s)** There is a lot of little gotchas and stuff like that. So I was actually hoping to dig into this a little bit with you today Lee sort of talking about some of the connectivity stuff and like why that port mapping stuff can be such a headache.

**[10:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=648s)** Yeah.

**[10:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=650s)** So if you run a large network and I always like to use an airport as an example right like you run a large network and it's an IPV for network and you.

**[11:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=660s)** Supplying ports and connectivity options to thousands of perhaps millions of devices right there is a limited number of ports and a limited number of IP addresses on an IPV for network.

**[11:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=672s)** And one of the things you run into as a network engineer if you have to handle stuff like that is that you're running to nap table exhaustion right.

**[11:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=680s)** So if a client opens a port and outbound connected port to something and it holds that port open for a very long time.

**[11:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=687s)** You end up in a situation where new clients can't do anything because the nap table that like maps the port and the IP address for the connection.

**[11:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=696s)** You just run out of options right like there's just not a lot you can do.

**[11:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=699s)** So one of the things that is part of the rfc for that is like okay well if you're running large networks and you do lots of connectivity stuff.

**[11:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=707s)** You should every single new TCP connection should recycle a port and then have it be very ephemeral.

**[11:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=714s)** That way nothing holds these things open for a long time and you don't run into this problem when new clients actually can't do anything.

**[12:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=721s)** So the easiest way to fix this is everybody should just go and use IPv6 and there was a lot more IP addresses available and you don't have to deal with this stuff anymore.

**[12:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=728s)** Yes, you're right.

**[12:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=730s)** The year of IPv6 is just around the corner.

**[12:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=734s)** So I mean obviously AWS is the archetypal example of a very large network for most organizations right.

**[12:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=740s)** You can run lots of EC2 instances, lots of Lambda functions and a whole bunch of other stuff.

**[12:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=744s)** So it makes perfect sense for AWS to enforce port and IP dependent mapping.

**[12:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=751s)** Because otherwise they would have lots and lots of support questions that basically said, hey I can't create our connections from my VPC and the answer would be we'll turn some stuff off then.

**[12:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=760s)** So it makes perfect sense why they would do that.

**[12:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=763s)** But it does cause a problem for tail scale unfortunately.

**[12:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=767s)** I think I mentioned this in the last webinar, I'm going to do it in every webinar.

**[12:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=770s)** If you're going to create a new VPC tomorrow, make it an IPv6 dual subnet, a dual IP VPC, turn on IPv6.

**[12:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=779s)** Let's let's like start normalizing this please so that you can make your life a little bit easier.

**[13:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=785s)** Yeah, well on that topic DeMine you ask a question about tail scales priority for IPv6 over V4 for establishing p2p connections, not just in Amazon but everywhere.

**[13:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=797s)** Is it easier and more efficient for me to use IPv6 or what?

**[13:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=801s)** Yeah, tail scale will actually like let's say your internet service provider at home like mine mine does give me both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address.

**[13:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=810s)** And so if you can if both sides of the equation have an IPv6 connectable address, it will prioritize that for obvious reasons because it gives you direct connections.

**[13:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=821s)** You don't need to do anything so there's no configuration required on the tail scale side, we handle all this volume.

**[13:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=827s)** One of the core tenants of tenants of tail scale is that we should remove as much of this complexity from you as possible.

**[13:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=835s)** And so we just handle the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 as needed.

**[14:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=841s)** One of the biggest the biggest benefits that you can add to a tail scale network is to have the egress point so like your internet service provider or your internet provider.

**[14:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=852s)** If it has IPv6 that will give you a really, really pleasant tail scale life quite frankly, not everybody has the ability to do that though.

**[14:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=859s)** So the only configuration option that you can turn on with tail scale is that you can actually disable IPv4 for the device IP addresses.

**[14:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=868s)** If you want to, I haven't really found a reasonable reason why most people would do that yet, unless they're doing particularly large networks.

**[14:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=875s)** So, you know, if you if you're running lots of tail scale devices, you might want to enable IPv6 only so you can have this really large network, but that's the only reason I can think of.

**[14:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=886s)** As a follow up question, what if I already have created a VPC and it's not IPv6, is that an immutable thing in VPC creation?

**[14:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=894s)** Yes, I believe it is, yes.

**[14:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=897s)** Yeah, it's hard to turn on IPv6 for a VPC.

**[15:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=900s)** Although I haven't tested it, so maybe I will after this, I believe it's pretty hard to do, but I'm not sure.

**[15:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=908s)** So I'll do a check.

**[15:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=909s)** All right, well, watch this space and maybe we'll talk about it next time.

**[15:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=913s)** If it's the year of IPv6, maybe the AWS will change it, right? Maybe that'll change, we'll see.

**[15:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=919s)** Maybe. Ben Smith just wanted to give a quick shout out to Sheridan computers for the brand new tail scale OpenSense plugin.

**[15:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=926s)** This is another example of our fantastic community doing cool and awesome stuff with tail scale.

**[15:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=932s)** So you can now configure tail scale directly from the OpenSense UI at last rather than dropping to the command line, even though that's my preference.

**[15:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=939s)** You can now click up to your way to victory.

**[15:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=942s)** Thank you very much to Sheridan computers for that.

**[15:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=945s)** Now, Bedar writes in saying a friend of mine is a network engineer and doesn't like the fact that tail scale bypasses the firewall.

**[15:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=952s)** He feels like he's using control when he uses it because people can just do what they like.

**[15:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=957s)** How can I convince him to use tail scale and that it's secure?

**[16:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=963s)** I think this is a very reasonable consideration.

**[16:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=967s)** So what I'm going to do is I'm going to start by saying telescope uses protocols, the stun and the turn protocol that are very established protocols for creating peer-to-peer connections.

**[16:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=981s)** So, you know, if you disable things like UPNP on that PCP or PMP, which are all pop mapping protocols on your network, it will not re you it will not do like use any of like UPNPs are very insecure protocol at this point is 30 years old.

**[16:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=996s)** It's on every own router, but it's had its fair share of security concerns.

**[16:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1002s)** You know, if you turn those things off, then tail scale will create relay connections.

**[16:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1006s)** And then there are things that you can do to completely block tail scale from being able to use your network.

**[16:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1011s)** I'm not going to go into those because I don't want to encourage them as a solution.

**[16:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1015s)** The answer that I would give to, you know, a concern network engineer is that, you know, these protocols are really well established and the only real reason that I can think of that you would not want tail scale to connect to another tail scale client is because you really want to be able to see every single packet of traffic that is egressing out of your network.

**[17:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1039s)** Generally, that is for environments with like high compliance requirements, maybe, you know, if you are communicating with, you know, government officials outside of signal, you, you know, you need to be able to make sure that all the egress packets are valid.

**[17:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1060s)** I personally can't see a real reason why that would be if because most of the time what you want to do is stop unencrypted traffic, leaving the, you know, leaving the network, tail skills encrypted end to end.

**[17:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1072s)** So, you know, you can certainly block tail scale and from being able to be used on your network, I think it's probably going to be a tough conversation to convince somebody to use tail scale if they have those levels of concerns.

**[18:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1083s)** I think that's probably a losing battle.

**[18:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1085s)** So, I think there's another angle to this as well that we haven't covered yet, which is tail scales are software defined network.

**[18:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1092s)** And as such, you can control in a much more fine grained fashion than you ever could with historical firewalls.

**[18:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1100s)** Now, I can hear network guys reaching for their keyboards as I speak, but an SDN based network software defined network, you can control every single client's view of the world, like individually.

**[18:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1113s)** And so, what I would say to your security guy is that just by giving you that fine grained control, like I said, you can do it on a per device level because each device authenticates individually and creates its own tunnel and connection back to the mesh network.

**[18:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1128s)** Every single time you make a change to your ACL rule set or your grants rule set or even your device posture management stuff, there's a whole bunch of stuff that's just not available in traditional firewalls.

**[19:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1142s)** Like, does Cisco even allow, maybe it does, it's genuine question, but does Cisco say, right, this device is running iOS 18.3, you shall pass this device is running 18.2, you shall not pass.

**[19:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1156s)** I got to know, but there's a bunch of knobs and dials and things that you can turn that historically, you just couldn't.

**[19:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1162s)** And then building on what Lee said about end to end encryption as well, because these devices are on a mesh network and they create direct device to device connections.

**[19:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1172s)** The tunnel is established from device to device and is encrypted end to end now, that can be a security guys worst nightmare because they can no longer do deep packet inspection.

**[19:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1182s)** So you might have to do some slight rethinking of the way in which you monitor traffic on, I don't know employees or whatever it is you're trying to monitor here, I don't know.

**[19:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1191s)** But what I would say is there's just in general a software based solution is always going to be way more flexible than pretty much any other option that you've got available to you.

**[20:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1201s)** Yeah, I think that's a really much better explanation than I had and I'm going to add on top of that as well.

**[20:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1208s)** You know, if you're in the sort of environment where you want to block all egress traffic and only white list certain traffic, then tell scale isn't to be able to get out of your network anyway, right?

**[20:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1217s)** Like, so from from my perspective, you know, it depends on your threat concerns and your threat model.

**[20:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1224s)** And if you're already in a network where you want to basically white list every outbound connection, first of all, you're going to have a really great time updating firewall rules.

**[20:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1231s)** So enjoy your enjoy your day to day job. And secondly, you know, you're going to end up with a position where all of your all of all other VPNs are all of the remote connectivity solutions are not viable anyway, right?

**[20:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1247s)** So yeah, I think that's a really great really great way of phrasing it Alex.

**[20:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1252s)** Yeah, it's a thought experiment because we're you know, we're kind of turning the traditional networking model a little bit on its head here. So great question.

**[21:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1260s)** And thank you so much for asking it and it's one we would happily talk about for some time, but there are some other questions to get to.

**[21:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1267s)** So on the zoom side, there's a question here about service accounts for Windows clients.

**[21:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1272s)** How are the credentials stored? I guess the question might be on each device. How are the credentials stored?

**[21:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1278s)** Will it yeah, will it sign in and establish VPN connections automatically for me?

**[21:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1285s)** Yeah, so I think before we talk about the window side, I think it's good to differentiate on the tail scale side, the difference between credentials.

**[21:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1292s)** So we have what I like to think of human being user credentials, which we use via the IDC protocol via SSO.

**[21:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1300s)** You log in via G suite or octa or Microsoft entry ID and those credentials are you know typed in by you as a user and authenticate who you are.

**[21:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1310s)** And then secondly, we have generally we recommend this for shared machines or the people the machines that don't have a user.

**[21:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1317s)** Like associated with it. So like you might serve in the cloud or your NAS box at home. Those things are authenticated via OAuth credentials, which are kind of programmatically generated and I shared between lots and lots of users.

**[22:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1333s)** If you want to be able to have tail scale logging automatically, it depends on the type of Windows machine we're talking about.

**[22:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1342s)** This is an RDP server that you want to RDP to you should use the OAuth credentials and you don't need to service account at all.

**[22:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1351s)** But there are mechanisms within the Windows installer that will allow it to start upon like upon startup and it's like a system policy that you would roll out via an MDM or via another system policy operator.

**[22:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1366s)** And then if you want to do that for a Windows device that's like a laptop like a users laptop. Again, you can actually set it to run on startup.

**[22:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1375s)** I need to fish out the MDM program like profile. I don't know if I trust the team can can grab that it's like running unattended mode.

**[23:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1383s)** And what that will do is authenticate as a human user for that laptop in the background without having to do an automatic prompt.

**[23:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1390s)** We don't really have the concept of service accounts in the Windows world like a service account is generally just an account that lives in an active directory that has no real credentials and isn't associated with a user.

**[23:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1401s)** That's more of an OAuth thing for us. If you are running as a service account on a Windows machine, you can specify all of credentials for the tail scale client and then run it as a.

**[23:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1413s)** My service account on the Windows side, but the credentials will be provided from there.

**[23:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1418s)** We have some documentation on this in the MDM system policy section of our documentation and it's unattended mode is what you're looking for.

**[23:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1427s)** Yes, Windows service like I was trying to run bezel, you know, the lightweight monitoring tool.

**[23:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1435s)** BES ZEL. There's a video on the telescope YouTube channel, by the way, if you want to find out more, it's a lightweight monitoring solution.

**[24:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1442s)** But I was trying to run it on my Windows box to monitor my gaming GPU because I was having my 10 gig Nick kept dropping out on my gaming PC and it was driving me crazy.

**[24:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1452s)** And I wanted to run this in the background. So I ended up having to use this thing called non sucking service manager to run a service in the background of Windows.

**[24:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1460s)** And I'm just thinking on Linux, it's just so easy with system D, but the tail scale client, like you said, Lee has the unattended mode built in and that basically does the same thing.

**[24:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1471s)** So I just put a little note to you in Slack, by the way, Lee for something else coming up shortly. But before we get there, perspective customer David Lawson has asked a pretty interesting question about.

**[24:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1484s)** Is tail scale a suitable option for establishing a VPN like tunnel between a go daddy hosted website and a billing vendors server?

**[24:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1495s)** I don't know if it would because I don't know if go go daddy allows you to install tail scale at any point. And I don't know if the billing vendor would if you have the ability to install tail scale on those devices, then yes.

**[25:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1506s)** If you don't have the ability to install tail scale on those devices, then no, I think that's the the short and sweet answer there.

**[25:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1511s)** Do you have any other thoughts like how we might solve this?

**[25:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1515s)** No, if it's a hosted site, you've likely got access through something like C panel if that's even still a thing I don't recall.

**[25:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1523s)** Dredged that up from the doldrums of my brain, but typically these days, it's very common to run a lightweight VPS for that reason.

**[25:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1532s)** So you've got root access to the box, the thing is running on. And then from there, you can do whatever you want. If it's a hosted service, you are kind of just waiting.

**[25:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1542s)** You know, you kind of hamstrung by the support that the hosted service offers.

**[25:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1548s)** One caveat that just came to mind, if you're building your application in some sort of language like go or something that has a C binding, you can use our TS net application.

**[25:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1559s)** If you written it and go to embed tail scale directly in the application, which, you know, depending on what your website is in go daddy, it might be a backend service.

**[26:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1569s)** If it's a JavaScript service, the probably limited options. But if you have some sort of backend service, then there might be a few options there.

**[26:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1576s)** A little bit more information about about what this website looks like in the billing service that you're using.

**[26:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1581s)** Right.

**[26:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1582s)** Yeah, so a quick question, I think that's come through on the YouTube side. I'll just answer pretty quickly.

**[26:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1587s)** Our past keys already implemented to authenticate to the tail scale admin console.

**[26:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1592s)** And for the most part, that's actually going to be up to the OAuth provider themselves to implement.

**[26:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1597s)** So we support out the box, Google, Apple, GitHub. There's another one I forget as well as custom OIDC providers.

**[26:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1605s)** So if that provider supports past keys for authentication, then tail scale will support it too.

**[26:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1612s)** Indeed.

**[26:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1614s)** Okay. So, all right. There was a question here from George lead. I was hoping you'd pick up on the zoom side.

**[27:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1623s)** Yeah, the, the division resolve thing.

**[27:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1626s)** That's it. Yeah.

**[27:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1627s)** Yes. Okay. So we really need to know, George, what sort of network you behind on both sides.

**[27:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1635s)** If you are running into latency problems, you are more than likely running in through a relay server and DaVinci resolve probably needs pretty.

**[27:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1644s)** You know, because it's a video editing thing latency probably matters.

**[27:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1648s)** I think the best advice I have for you is to kind of read our device connectivity and then use my little tools stunner on both sides.

**[27:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1657s)** Okay. So wherever you're running DaVinci resolve from, you're on stunner on that side and then wherever you're connecting from, it will tell you what type of connection you have and whether you will get direct connections or not.

**[27:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1667s)** We can share it in.

**[27:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1670s)** I'm just going to sorry for my keyboard clacking while I grab the link.

**[27:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1674s)** How much of a game early?

**[27:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1676s)** I'm a play state. I'm not a PC gamer. I haven't been for a little while. I was back in the day. I was a big counter strike person back in the day.

**[28:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1683s)** But I'm more of a PlayStation game now and I'm more of a like story generated game type thing. So I just finished Alan Wake too, which was absolutely marvelous.

**[28:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1694s)** So yeah, I'm not much of a PC gamer at this point. I don't think.

**[28:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1698s)** Well, the reason I ask is because I've seen it online as tech tips and this is me admitting I watched the crazy orange Canadian guy.

**[28:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1706s)** Where he uses parsec, which is a game streaming engine, which I think is self hostable. And certainly if it isn't, you might want to look into something called moonlight and sunlight as a pair of clients, which I think is an open source implementation of the Nvidia game stream engine.

**[28:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1722s)** And because obviously it's designed for gaming latencies, obviously very important when it comes to a lot of video games.

**[28:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1729s)** And so what you might find is that by using a gaming grade solution, you might be able to reduce any latency that way.

**[28:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1737s)** It will put a little bit of load on your graphics cards and coding engine. So if you're rendering out a video from DaVinci, maybe that will impact the rendering speed a little bit of the output speed.

**[29:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1748s)** Yeah, give past a go or moonlight and sunlight and or sunshine and moonlight. Sorry. And let us know if you want to come back to a future live stream and comment and tell us how that worked or it didn't work.

**[29:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1759s)** I'd love to see it because it's been in my video queue to make a video about that for streaming games to esteem deck over the tailnet for some time. I just haven't quite gotten to it yet. But maybe I should put that further up my list.

**[29:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1772s)** That sounds like a great little video.

**[29:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1775s)** I want to add Alex and looking forward to it.

**[29:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1778s)** Okay, cool. So what else do we have here? Authentication question from David Hubeck.

**[29:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1784s)** Intel scale. Oh, yeah, go ahead then.

**[29:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1787s)** No, no, I mean, feel free to read it out. I just think I was a really interesting one. So yeah, feel free to go ahead.

**[29:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1792s)** Can tell scale pass authentication parameters or sorry, off parameters as an HTTP header to an engine ex application, i.e. net box.

**[30:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1801s)** Instance into a cloud, but secure the access using tail scale.

**[30:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1807s)** Yes, it can. And it's really cool. And it's one of our my favorite parts of tail scale.

**[30:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1813s)** So you we have this, you know, it's it's kind of like buried in our open source repo.

**[30:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1819s)** I'm going to put it in the zoom chat and hopefully somebody can copy it over to the.

**[30:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1825s)** YouTube chat. Like a little engine ex off proxy that you will run alongside your engine ex instance.

**[30:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1833s)** And it actually, you know, registers a device in tail scale and then uses the HTTP.

**[30:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1840s)** The authentication headers from tail scale directly to identify who you are.

**[30:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1845s)** It's really cool. There is one for caddy as well, which is kind of in our community projects, which was announced today, the caddy.

**[30:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1852s)** We have one for Grafana. This is a really, really, I think this is a really awesome way of handling authentication for internal applications, just building tail scale directly into them.

**[31:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1862s)** And then you have the permissions and stuff already embedded.

**[31:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1865s)** Yeah, I would love to see somebody give this a try.

**[31:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1870s)** It's been a little while since I've run it. It's been about a year since I run it, but it worked flawlessly when I gave it a try.

**[31:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1875s)** So highly recommended. I think there's a really great way of handling authentication without having to worry about.

**[31:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1881s)** You know, it should be basic off or like tying it to your identity provider.

**[31:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1886s)** We also have TSI and P, which we again, we announced this part of the community projects today.

**[31:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1891s)** So there's lots of options in this space for you.

**[31:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1894s)** Absolutely. So I'm going to move on now to talking a little bit about grants and ACLs, I think.

**[31:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1902s)** Because the question that I have here in the live chat is from Lynn and Guin.

**[31:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1909s)** How to not show how to not to show list of devices in network devices for a specific group or users?

**[31:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1919s)** In, I'm assuming when what they're talking about here is that they are connected to tail scale and they go to the network devices and they just see a list of all the devices that are on the tail there.

**[32:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1929s)** That's to be true. Yeah. I mean, my assumption here is that that's because you have a white little like a very broad permissive ACL.

**[32:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1937s)** The network devices will only show the devices that you can connect to.

**[32:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1941s)** And so if you set up grants or ACLs to permit to segment your network, you only see the things that you can actually connect to.

**[32:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1948s)** And if you run tail scale status, it shows the same output.

**[32:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1951s)** So if you start implementing ACLs, that list will condense pretty dramatically.

**[32:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1958s)** So only the things that you can actually connect to.

**[32:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1961s)** And I'll tell you what else you can do as well.

**[32:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1963s)** With the grants, you can limit subnet devices seeing specific subnets via subnet routers.

**[32:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1971s)** So this might actually also be something we should have mentioned in the previous question about the network security guy feeling nervous about tail scale.

**[32:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1979s)** But let's say I have a remote subnet of, I don't know, it doesn't matter what the side there is.

**[33:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1984s)** But I don't want every device in my tail net being able to now reach devices on that remote subnet via the subnet router.

**[33:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1991s)** Well, I can limit based on groups and tags and all sorts of different parameters.

**[33:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=1996s)** Who can see or what devices are allowed to route packets to that remote subnet using the tail scale grants features as part of your ACLs.

**[33:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2005s)** The other thing you can do is just simply limit devices based on specific tags.

**[33:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2010s)** So you might want all of your servers to be able to see each of all of your other servers for the stuff like replication and stuff like that.

**[33:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2016s)** But maybe you don't want your, I don't know, robot vacuum to be able to see your server for some reason.

**[33:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2023s)** You can limit again, you can limit that traffic.

**[33:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2026s)** Those routes that tail scale publishes to each client.

**[33:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2029s)** It's a software-defined solution, of course.

**[33:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2031s)** So it's incredibly flexible.

**[33:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2033s)** Just based on tagging those devices and do it all in the the admin console using the ACLs.

**[34:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2040s)** And ACLs are the most powerful part of tail scale that I think a lot of home users probably don't leverage because they trust everything on their network.

**[34:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2051s)** But there's still lots of other benefits to it as well. So yeah.

**[34:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2055s)** Absolutely.

**[34:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2056s)** OK, so what else do we have going on here? There's a question from Avino.

**[34:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2063s)** I'm dreadfully sorry about that but you're in, but the general question is I have a residential proxy network.

**[34:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2070s)** And I'm running into half of my proxy is not being able to use you PNP to forward the traffic to the listing HTTP server.

**[34:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2078s)** Can I use tail scale to help with that?

**[34:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2080s)** Yes.

**[34:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2083s)** OK, great next question.

**[34:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2084s)** Yeah, it's all tail scale on both sides.

**[34:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2087s)** And you know, you get a private encrypted connection.

**[34:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2091s)** If you're not, if you can't enable you PNP, you may struggle to get direct connections, but you'll certainly be able to talk to them and be able to communicate.

**[34:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2098s)** And tail scale will handle all that for you.

**[35:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2101s)** I highly recommend giving it a go. I think that's going to be a big quality of life improvement for you.

**[35:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2106s)** OK, now I will be the first to admit I'm not a domain expert on Slack's nebula tool, but there's a question here from who may again apologies for the pronunciation.

**[35:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2118s)** How does tail scale differ from Slack's nebula overlay networking tool?

**[35:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2125s)** I think the main, it's been a very long time since I've looked at nebula for maybe five years.

**[35:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2131s)** So my experience might be outdated.

**[35:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2134s)** I believe nebula is TLS based as far as I'm aware.

**[35:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2140s)** So it has a built in TLS certificate authentication mechanism that it does to encrypt the two nodes.

**[35:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2150s)** TLS bill uses wire guard. I have very strong opinions on TLS connectivity versus wire guard connectivity.

**[35:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2157s)** But, you know, I think that the main things to bear in mind when it comes to nebula versus tail scale.

**[36:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2164s)** Tail scale is a man of service for the most part. You just have to install the clients.

**[36:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2168s)** Nebula is something you would have to run yourself operational overhead is a very real thing. And, you know, your time is precious and you are paid a really.

**[36:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2177s)** Looking at Slack nebula, I imagine you probably paid a pretty pretty good salary as some sort of system engineer of DevOps engineer and your time is very valuable.

**[36:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2186s)** And if you want to spend that time maintaining a tool night nebula, then, you know, more power to you.

**[36:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2191s)** But tail scale can do a very simple thing, a very similar thing for a very fraction of the cost of your salary. So yeah.

**[36:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2199s)** Yeah, and I think it boils down to really how much control you need over each piece of the jigsaw puzzle.

**[36:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2206s)** So nebula requires, I believe, some self hosting components of what are called lighthouses for discovery.

**[36:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2213s)** Whereas tail scale is a managed service. We provide all of that stuff for you for free, or unless you're a business customer, of course, it's not free. But, you know, for the most part, like there is no infrastructure that you have to host yourself.

**[37:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2226s)** We also integrate with a ton of identity providers, as I mentioned, Google, Microsoft, Apple, GitHub, which is really just Microsoft, you know, in a, in a coat.

**[37:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2238s)** And OIDC providers as well, whereas I believe, like Lee was saying with nebula, you've got to create your own CA generate keys for each machine network and kind of update all of that stuff manually.

**[37:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2248s)** Whereas tail scale just takes care of that for you automatically with everything in the background.

**[37:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2252s)** So I'm not qualified to talk about performance of the two. Maybe that could be something we look into in the future as a video for the channel, but.

**[37:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2261s)** Well, I think I think something that's worth pointing out that there's all the TLS base VPNs, you know, on named TLS base, but TLS base connectivity things.

**[37:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2271s)** The better or worse, the TLS stack is very CPU intensive.

**[37:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2276s)** You know, the encryption overhead is very very CPU intensive. Why I got, which obviously tail scale is built on, is been designed from the ground up to be extremely performant and to be extremely, you know, in a modern protocol than some of the TLS site as a 40 years old, right?

**[38:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2294s)** Like they're not going to be a CPU intensive.

**[38:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2296s)** The final thing that I want to say on this topic and I'm going to put my sales engineering hat on for a second, because I think it's important.

**[38:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2303s)** You know, one thing that we do as systems engineers is we, we try really hard to save the company money, right? And what I mean by that is, let's go and run this open source tool because, you know, it's free for the company.

**[38:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2316s)** And I don't have to go through budgeting and, you know, procurement and all those different things that are important.

**[38:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2324s)** I think that, you know, when I'm biased, so please be aware of that, like, you know, your salary as a system engineer or a network engineer or something like that is, you know, almost certainly, let's say a hypothetical number, you paid $100,000 a year.

**[39:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2340s)** If you spend half of your time managing something like Slack nebula, that's really not an efficient use of money for the company, right?

**[39:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2348s)** There's other things that you could be doing. There's providing value for your organization. I guarantee that unless you are rolling out a very, very large deployment of tail scale, it's not going to cost $50,000, right?

**[39:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2359s)** Like, you know, it's a lot harder for you to go through the procurement process, but at the end of the day, you're going to have a fully managed service that, you know, is a much more cost efficient use of your time than running an open source product manually.

**[39:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2374s)** This is why cloud providers are so successful, right? Like every single person that I know that a system engineer thinks they can run a set of compute for much cheaper than $8 an hour that it costs for a GPU instance in the cloud, but, you know, from a practicality perspective, it doesn't really make much sense because, you know, there's a bunch of other benefits on top of that.

**[39:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2397s)** I hope that the mentality of like, you know, let's go run Slack nebula because it's free.

**[40:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2403s)** You know, that's definitely a viable perspective. I just disagree with it for what I'm putting at it, right?

**[40:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2409s)** Like, I think you can use your 50% of your time to do, you know, much faster delivery of applications for your customers so that your businesses customers get value quicker.

**[40:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2421s)** Kubernetes is cowering nervously in the corner from Lee as well.

**[40:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2425s)** I mean, yeah, I don't even get me started Alex, we can do a whole hour long thing about that trade off yet.

**[40:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2432s)** Yeah, I mean, I just I just think back to when I used to work for a bank in London and we were.

**[40:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2438s)** We were looking at implementing OpenShift and there were this, this is like 20 I guess 14 15 timeframe.

**[40:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2445s)** So this is back when OpenShift was still running on top of rail and there was no immutable like Coro space image and it was all Ansible playbooks and hand cranked stuff this that and the other.

**[40:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2455s)** And we did like a six month project to build this thing out in an enterprise environment and I just think now of the spend required to hand crank this thing that really EKS probably would have done everything we needed.

**[41:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2467s)** You know, it's always a trade off between a SaaS and a self hosted solution, obviously I spend a lot of my time my personal time doing self hosted stuff but at work, you know, the calculus is different leads these absolutely spot on with that.

**[41:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2480s)** I think doing it at home, so you learn how all the things fit together is a really important part in like learning growth, but, you know, we all want to spend eight hours a day at work, not 20 hours, you know, 12 hours at work.

**[41:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2491s)** And so that is material impact right.

**[41:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2494s)** Absolutely now Jake writes in hello, I got a really easy name for you to pronounce. Yes, I appreciate that one. Thank you. What are some of the most uncommon use cases for tail scale that you've seen personally and found interesting or amusing.

**[41:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2509s)** The great, this is a great question.

**[41:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2512s)** We're limiting a one I can share on a public channel for obvious reasons, we are under NDAs and stuff like that, I will say that to my knowledge, we have tail scale in deep sea, deep sea vehicles, so very, very, very far under the ocean.

**[42:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2531s)** We have tail scale and agricultural equipment, so I think tractors and things like that, we have tail scale that is very close to going into space, which I think is amazing.

**[42:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2546s)** You know, it's really, I think it's really, if you're doing any sort of IOT connectivity, tail scale has almost become the de facto solution for that because of its lightweight profile, you can install it on basically on the operating system.

**[42:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2558s)** You know, I have a strong hope that tail scale will be in mode of vehicles and in the near future, based on some things that some organizations are exploring.

**[42:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2570s)** The most interesting use of tail scale that I think I've personally seen on the most humorous use of tail scale is really around, you know, we get a lot of organizations that come to us and like, yeah, our database has been on the public internet for a very, very long time because that was the only way we thought we could do it.

**[43:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2589s)** It's really interesting for me because, you know, ultimately what customers want to be able to do is connect, they want to just get their application connected to a database or their thing connected to another thing.

**[43:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2600s)** And for a long time, they were quite happy just exposing those things to the public internet.

**[43:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2605s)** You know, I don't think that's a tenable thing in the modern internet, especially when you see things like the ingress engine X vulnerability that was announced yesterday, I'll drop yesterday, like, you know, if you, if you have any footprint,

**[43:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2618s)** if you have your intellectual property on it or something that is a high-value thing for your organization, putting tail scale on both sides of it is just going to make your life way, what you're going to sleep way better at night.

**[43:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2630s)** And so those are ones that are most humorous to me is where like, yeah, our database has been on the public internet with a password for 10 years and we've figured it's finally time to stop doing that.

**[44:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2640s)** We're like, probably it's time, let's help you figure that out.

**[44:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2644s)** But it's getting as dangerous. I'm just going to come out and say it, like, can you pull people exposing admission? This is confession time with Alex.

**[44:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2652s)** When I was 17, I thought it would be a good idea to put a Windows remote desktop on the public internet.

**[44:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2659s)** And I pulled forward in 3, 3, 8, 9, no less. I didn't even move it. I didn't even do like security through obscurity.

**[44:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2665s)** And the password for my desktop computer at the time was 22, literally 22, because I was lazy and 17 and stupid, right?

**[44:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2675s)** You can probably guess how that ended up.

**[44:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2678s)** Yes. I can imagine how that ended up.

**[44:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2682s)** Nowadays, it had a Bitcoin minor on there in about five minutes, but I don't know what it was to do back in the day.

**[44:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2688s)** Yeah, goodness knows. I mean, botnets were a thing and stuff, I guess.

**[44:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2693s)** Did any of them have a sub zero or sub seven or something where you would like have a, you would be able to open people's CD drives back in the day.

**[45:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2700s)** And you remember that trojan?

**[45:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2702s)** Oh, it was awesome. Yeah, sub seven, I think it was called.

**[45:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2705s)** Yeah.

**[45:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2706s)** Yeah. So look, I think my favorite absolute favorite tail scale kind of bit of law is to, you know, the craziness people do with tail scale is someone rooted their robot vacuum cleaner.

**[45:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2716s)** It was running a Ubuntu underneath. So they installed tail scale on it. And then they could control their their robot back from wherever they were.

**[45:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2724s)** There's been a lot of really cool stuff like we're talking with some motorsports teams right now as well.

**[45:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2728s)** Again, I can't for NDA reasons say who? But, you know, a bunch of students are using it as well to really just remove the the stodge of networking teams in higher education and get them out of their way and make them more productive as students to be able to connect to each other.

**[45:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2745s)** And, you know, one of them's hosting the database on their laptop. And then they're connecting the three or four people that are in the computer science like group back to that person's laptop and all developing against that same database instead of doing what we did at school of emailing things around on Facebook messenger in zip files God forbid.

**[46:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2763s)** So there's just there's a lot of really cool ways people using tail scale. And, you know, I try and highlight as many of them as I can on the YouTube channel like self hosted applications like image to replace Google photo.

**[46:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2774s)** As well as home assistant being an open source home automation platform.

**[46:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2779s)** We saw with Plex just last week that they've announced a big change to remote streaming and how that's now going to be locked behind a paywall.

**[46:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2787s)** If you're using tail scale or something like jelly fin, that news is just like water offer ducks back to you. You don't care about what, you know, Plexa monetizing this week.

**[46:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2797s)** You know, there's a huge range of applications to tail scale, not just talking about business things as we tend to on this stream, but, you know, looking at home lab situations and sort of self hosting and just really fun and interesting things.

**[46:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2812s)** Yeah, another one that just came to mind actually is healthcare. We seem to be pretty saturated in healthcare organizations and, you know, those organizations are doing things like cancer research and, you know, solving medical problems and that feels very, you know, gives me the warm and fuzzy is that we're actually helping to solve some of the worst diseases that the human population has to deal with.

**[47:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2835s)** So, you know, you know, always, always good to feel like you're giving back as well, right.

**[47:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2840s)** I'm reliably informed as well that tail scales running in space these days.

**[47:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2845s)** I didn't realize it had been launched, but yes, I knew I'm on track. Yeah.

**[47:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2849s)** Yeah, which is blows my mind. It's super cool.

**[47:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2853s)** So there's a question from a chap called DIY till I die with this completing round four of the post quantum cryptography easy for me to say trials and looking to publish standard soon.

**[47:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2867s)** Where is tail scale going to go with their implementation plan on the PQC train.

**[47:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2873s)** I actually, we had a very answer this question back when Avery was on the podcast on the on the stream a little while ago.

**[48:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2881s)** I don't think we have any plans in this space just yet.

**[48:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2884s)** I will say that I was very hopeful that we were like the tail, the wire guard encryption protocol was going to make it into nips.

**[48:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2895s)** Fist, Fips, excuse me, Fips 140 dash three and it didn't, which was pretty sad for us on the on the sales side.

**[48:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2907s)** But I don't have a better answer than the one that Avery gave like six or seven months ago, which was like once, once creeper quantum cryptography is something that we need to worry about.

**[48:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2918s)** It is something that we will invest time in. I think we're still in the hypothetical phases of the quantum cryptography movement.

**[48:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2926s)** And right now we're kind of hand where focused on making sure that our cryptography is suitable for the pre quantum world basically.

**[48:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2936s)** Yes, and of course we write on top of the wire guard library, which itself is subject to independent scrutiny for cryptography standards and all that kind of stuff.

**[49:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2946s)** What I would say in just response to this in terms of like tail scale being an innovator in the space.

**[49:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2951s)** We have some of the founding members of incredibly influential projects in the computing world.

**[49:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2959s)** I can't even begin to name half of them to be honest there's just so I'm surrounded by geniuses at this company and I don't I don't say that lightly.

**[49:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2969s)** And so I think to be honest, you can probably sleep easily to know that we're we're on top of this stuff and sort of looking at it too.

**[49:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2975s)** And when the time is ready Avery and and pals in you know in the engineering team will let you know indeed.

**[49:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2986s)** Alright, so what's the recommended way to grant another company's access to certain resources via tail scale.

**[49:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=2993s)** Should they create their own tail scale account and accompanying tail net and then request access from us or is there a better way.

**[50:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3001s)** Do you have any thoughts on that I have some but I realize I've answered these questions for most of this stream so I want to make give you a chance to.

**[50:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3010s)** My answer is it depends really how big is the situation we're talking about if it's a couple of people then a tail net each and then sharing stuff is probably no big deal.

**[50:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3021s)** Equally, you could just add all those users to a single tail net because you get three seats for free and a hundred devices to once you start breaking through those kind of free tier thresholds that's where you're going to start to want to look for some of the other plans at tail scale make available with more seats and more devices and.

**[50:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3039s)** More features available to suit you know the esoteric stuff that business folk tend to get up to.

**[50:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3045s)** But really it depends as to whether an all in one situation with everybody joining the same tail net which typically means you've got to have email addresses on the same domain is viable or if it's two separate literally two separate companies then no sharing might be the way to go but then that has some caveats to.

**[51:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3064s)** Yeah you can do the invite external user thing as well but they need to have their own tail net for that to work there isn't currently away appearing tail nets and you'll notice i'm tactically using the word currently.

**[51:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3076s)** It certainly is an aspiration of thing that we want to be able to do at some point in the future if you have interesting being able to do something like that we want to hear from you.

**[51:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3084s)** But yeah inviting users and no sharing is probably the canonical way to do that right now.

**[51:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3092s)** Absolutely now there are some limitations with no sharing specifically around tagged nodes and a bunch of other stuff to.

**[51:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3099s)** Is to do with typically to do with identity of how a shared node works so rather than sharing a you know what so let's say for example you have a node on your tail net that has a specific tag.

**[51:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3109s)** And you share that node outside of your tail net will it's you doing the sharing so so far as the other person is concerned the tag owner will be you and your.

**[52:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3123s)** Identity not the tag inside your town it so you kind of lose some of the nuance between node sharing between townets and things like that I think like Lee was kind of alluding to that peering multiple tail nets together is something we might.

**[52:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3137s)** I don't know hypothetically be a rational yes, yes, yes, but we do see these requests coming in from times time and it's something that are engineering team are kind of working on prioritizing.

**[52:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3151s)** Absolutely i've got i've got a great question that i'd love to serve as ash zilpa says how does tail scale work and form connections behind cg net want to take a bash up out I'm going to kind of run with it.

**[52:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3166s)** i'm going to throw a link in the chat of how tail scale works, which is a fantastic blog post a company by natural so network address translation is the process of taking your internal subnet 192168 dot whatever and kind of converting that into a public when IP address because as you all know i'm sure we ran out of the version for IP addresses.

**[53:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3192s)** A long time ago so i'll put a couple of links in the chat whilst Lee drops his wisdom yes when i think is really unique about tail scale versus other remote access solutions or VPNs is that if you are using an isp that is using the cg net space.

**[53:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3213s)** You and i think we talked about this last time there are some of the newer isp's didn't get a public IPv4 block and so they have a very small number of egress points on their network so they hand out to their router.

**[53:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3228s)** A cg net address and then if you want to be able to connect to your home network you have to pay them extra for a public address.

**[53:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3235s)** tail scale is really unique because it figures out how to talk to other tail scale clients by traversing out through whatever network it is to the public internet and uses the stone and the turn protocols to do that and so it actually sees the egress address on the edge of your isp's network and then opens apart and holds it open for you to be able to use it.

**[54:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3258s)** And so when you look at the end points in the tail scale thing you'll see your home routers IP address you'll see the cg net address that the isp is handed out to your home router and then you'll see the public address that the isp is using and that what's really unique about that is that you allows you to connect to your home network even where other solutions would not allow you to do that.

**[54:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3280s)** I think it's really cool and it's runs or you know so organizations that we work with it's the only viable option for them to be able to connect to networks together because it's like double knatted and tail scale just traverses through it without having to worry too much about it so you know it's it's really really cool I really like that feature.

**[54:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3299s)** Yeah I mean for those aren't familiar with what cg net is or carry a grade net we did dive into this a little bit but we've only got about five minutes less I'm going to I'm going to draw us one out a little bit I think.

**[55:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3310s)** Carry a grade net basically means you don't get your own public IPv4 address and so if you wanted to self host a server or run indeed any kind of service behind that firewall there you have no front door on the internet which is essentially what you can think of an IPv4 address as.

**[55:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3327s)** And so tail scale gives you a way to kind of punch through all of that nonsense and just deal with your own network as if it's well yours really.

**[55:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3339s)** Alright so Jake Smith writes in the chat in response to the links we shared about natural verse and stuff like that that the natural verse or blog post is wonderfully dense in the best way grab a red ball maybe not a red ball because I don't approve of max a step and but.

**[55:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3353s)** Grab a red ball get comfortable and prepare to be there for a while am I right in thinking that you are boycotting entire products because of your loading of a formula on race driver because I think that's i'm here for that I am here for that yeah absolutely him Lewis all the way baby that's me no more red ball for you absolutely a little bit only lots of energy.

**[56:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3376s)** So i'm still i'm still upset about how twenty twenty one ended and here we are in twenty twenty five and i'm still i'm still upset that form at all was ruined for me that day.

**[56:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3386s)** It's a bit about it for years on one quick question that I noticed from Millard allisator hopefully i pronounce that right what's a recommended way for authentic authenticating VMs created in terraform on gcp if I add a token to the startup script it will be visible and readable maybe a short live token from tail scale all off.

**[56:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3405s)** The answer to this is so you could.

**[56:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3410s)** Generally we recommend storing those things in the secrets manager for your crowd provider i'm more familiar with AWS and Azure than I am gcp but in AWS you would use something like secrets manager or ssm and then on startup retrieve that value from that secrets manager i am very sure that Google Cloud has more.

**[57:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3428s)** And so you would store it in that particular secrets manager and then just retrieve it from there basically nice easy question to finishes out.

**[57:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3437s)** Can you inject cloud in it using gcp i imagine you can I think the startup script is cloud in it compatible i believe it's just the weather it's like a metadata startup script it's been ages since i've done a lot of gcp stuff so it's not my.

**[57:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3450s)** My primary of the three hyperscalers so you know i'm less familiar with it i'm sure how she could would i'm sure how she could would love to sell you a vault subscription there to deal with that yes i'm sure they would i think that probably rounds us out two minutes left i think so yeah yeah just a reminder till scale will be a cue con next week in London so if you are.

**[57:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3475s)** If you're going to be there please drop by the till scale boob and come and say hello to me and if you've seen us on the live stream let us know we'll give you a pair of socks or a hoodie or a t-shirt or whatever swag we have this time i'll have a pair of socks we got two different types of socks now and they're both.

**[58:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3493s)** We had purple ones at scale last month and I forgot to pick up a pair.

**[58:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3506s)** These ones.

**[58:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3508s)** I've just got one pair these with these fetching tail scale socks um that are very genzy compatible so come by and grab a pair from the tail scale boob.

**[58:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3518s)** Let's hope we don't punch holes in that socks pro i always think it should be like socks proxy joke in there somewhere but there you go one of my solutions engineering team made a socks and socks proxy joke in.

**[58:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3530s)** Slack with a customer last week and it was absolutely hilarious so i'm totally on board with that.

**[58:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3536s)** Very very last question before we get out of here are the premium features explained anywhere yes tail scale dot com slash pricing now where can folks go to get in touch with you and your teamly if they have any sales related questions or indeed just need more advice on tail scale.

**[59:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3553s)** If you want to talk directly to the sales team if you can email sales at tailscale dot com where an account executive who will totally not bother you I promise will.

**[59:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3564s)** We'll route you to one of us they will do ask you some questions about your use cases and all that kind of stuff just to make sure that to do the usual sales qualification I know that everybody who works in tech hates being talked to by sales people.

**[59:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3577s)** I used to hate it too but we all have a business to build and if you want tail scale to be successful if you love the product take it to work and spend money so that we can be a successful business you know it would be it would be.

**[59:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3590s)** Be really ashamed for us to not sell the product and everybody to continue using it home for free that would be a real shame.

**[59:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3597s)** Absolutely now folks can go to tailscale dot com slash contact slash sales to get more in touch with Lee and his team.

**[01:00:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M6ERYgw0GZA&t=3604s)** Thank you so much for watching until next time I've been Alex and I've been Lee see you next time folks thank you.
