# How Tailscale makes YouTube videos - A Behind the Scenes Studio Tour

**[00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=0s)** Welcome to my little Tailscale home studio tour. I don't really do this kind of thing very often, but I thought it might be interesting for some of you to see how I make the videos for the Tailscale channel in particular. So this is just a bedroom in the back of my house. There's nothing special whatsoever. Got a bunch of acoustic treatment in here because otherwise this small square room is a very nasty, teeny echo.

**[00:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=30s)** Really important to treat all of the vertical spaces, horizontal spaces with acoustic treatment, even take the doors off the closet, for example, and put a big curtain up there so that absorbs even more sound.

**[00:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=43s)** But really, it's a very modest space. There are two desks in here. This one is the back of shot, which you've probably seen this angle of me sat here before. This is behind the curtain, so to speak, this is where the camera sits.

**[00:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=59s)** And then on the other side of the room, if I flip you around, you can see that I have just a standard desk here, nothing too crazy going on.

**[01:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=71s)** But let's talk you through some of the decisions that I've made here as to why I did certain things a certain way, and talk you through the process of making one of these Tailscale videos.

**[01:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=83s)** So I have a bunch of gear here as you might expect to make videos. But for me, the single most important thing has been to reduce complexity.

**[01:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=94s)** So to have a dedicated way of, you know, a dedicated recording laptop, it's very nice to have a second laptop just to record on that way.

**[01:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=104s)** I don't need to log out of any personal profiles. I can make sure that everything that's on there, you know, the wallpapers are all configured in a specific way.

**[01:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=112s)** I've got this kind of very generic black background that's not going to distract too much from the rest of the visuals.

**[01:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=119s)** And then the other thing I do is I just use QuickTime screen recording. So on MacOS, if you do Command Shift 5, well, Command Shift 4 is a screenshot and Command Shift 5 actually records the screen.

**[02:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=130s)** I've enabled it so that it shows you clicks in the recording. So if I just bring a window over here, for example, you know, you should be able to see there's a little circle appears around the clicks just to accentuate them just a little bit.

**[02:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=141s)** And then the other thing, this, this took me a long time to figure out actually in my early videos, you might have noticed that I don't know if you've watched them, but maybe you did.

**[02:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=149s)** And the, the, the talking head portion, I had to float around the screen because it was just, I didn't think ahead to the editing step.

**[02:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=157s)** And if there's one thing I could implore into anybody watching this that has any ambition in making videos.

**[02:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=162s)** It's scripting, use a teleprompter, it will save you hours not only in the prep and recording stage, but also in the editing stage too.

**[02:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=170s)** Because you have a flow of what you're trying to say and the audio you're trying to say it in and, you know, modern editors don't necessarily have transcript-based editing still somehow.

**[03:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=180s)** I don't know how Final Cut still hasn't added that. But anyway, I digress.

**[03:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=186s)** So when you think about, when you think forward ahead to the editing process, you'll think about somewhere where, you know, in my tutorials, I like to have my head in the corner.

**[03:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=194s)** I think it makes them more engaging. I don't know. Maybe it doesn't. But I think it does.

**[03:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=199s)** And you want to, you know, you don't want to have your window full screen and then have a bunch of elements down here in the corner covering the air because people won't be able to see them because your heads in the way.

**[03:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=209s)** So you want to try. And I use this app called bento box, which is written by a former colleague of mine at Telskill.

**[03:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=216s)** And this, this app is not free. I think it's a few, a few dollars, but I love this thing. And it gives me access to basically different zones.

**[03:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=225s)** So you can see I've created a zone here of zone three and zones two and three.

**[03:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=229s)** I don't really want to put my window there. I want to put it over here. And as soon as I drop it, like a hold shift with my hand.

**[03:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=235s)** And then I just drag the window into the right spot. And I can do this too with other windows. You know, I can just, I can persist. These are free floating windows.

**[04:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=242s)** Then it kind of gives me the best of both worlds. It gives me like a tiling window manager coupled with, you know, just the reproducibility of being able, you know, just,

**[04:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=252s)** it makes life really easy in the editing. I have presets now in final cut that have my little talking head as the perfect size to fill this gap over here.

**[04:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=261s)** Well, that's probably how I'm talking to you right now, actually. And then, you know, so if I was, if I was to put content behind like it just doesn't look as good.

**[04:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=269s)** And so I know if I have this preset here, boom, and I go. And with bento box, it's really easy to in the layout editor, just make little changes.

**[04:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=278s)** Like if I want to move just a couple of pixels over here like that, close, about a being, about a boom. There you go.

**[04:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=285s)** You can even save different layouts for different types of things if you want to. And then the other thing that's worth noting is that this is a 16 by 9 4K monitor.

**[04:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=295s)** I did use to record with a big ultra wide and then the camera was off to the left. And that's another thing.

**[05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=300s)** You should try and put the camera, at least in my opinion, the camera off to the left of the screen. That way when you're looking at the screen in the recording, it looks like you're looking at the screen the person's looking at.

**[05:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=311s)** And the corner kind of looking up at the code that you're trying to talk about or edit was if you have the camera on this side, it doesn't work.

**[05:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=319s)** So I'm going to look at this screen now and you'll see like if I was on talking to you on this screen, I actually did this for a couple of months on this channel.

**[05:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=325s)** And you'll notice that it does come. I'm basically looking off the side of the screen versus here, whereas I'm looking directly at the stuff you're looking at.

**[05:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=334s)** The 16 by 9 screen here means that the aspect ratio when you bring it into the editor matches the target output you're going to have on YouTube or wherever you're putting this stuff.

**[05:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=344s)** And it just makes the whole again, it makes the whole editing process a lot, lot easier.

**[05:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=349s)** Every single stage of this entire process of this entire room is designed, you know, have a separate dedicated set of kit if you can swing it, you know, a separate desk that you don't have to tidy every single time.

**[06:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=362s)** Microphone, a separate camera, a separate set of lights, like if you could have a dedicated recording space to reduce the friction to press record.

**[06:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=371s)** Sounds like such a cliche because all the YouTubers say it, but having done this now as a, you know, my job for 18 months, I can tell you the mental friction required to get started when you know that you have to set up a tripod and a screen and then configure exposure.

**[06:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=387s)** And what did I do last time and where were the lights exactly and just do everything you can to make your life easier, including little tweaks like the bento box software, like a 16 by 9 screen, like a separate set of kit.

**[06:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=401s)** And then wherever possible, I find it really handy to have everything just going into a single thunderbolt hub down here.

**[06:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=409s)** So the entire laptop is connected just through a single thunderbolt cable here.

**[06:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=415s)** Okay, there's one HDMI going out to my teleprompter, which I'll get to in a minute.

**[07:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=420s)** But one single thunderbolt cable here and then all of, you know, the ethernet and the stream deck and things.

**[07:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=427s)** That's all connected directly into here so that if I do want to take this on the road when I'm traveling and stuff because it's a nice 14 inch size, I can do that.

**[07:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=436s)** What are some of the other goodies we've got in here?

**[07:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=438s)** The stream deck's probably a good place to start.

**[07:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=440s)** You can see that I've got the Amaran option here, a key light right and a hair light option as well as a ceiling fan option.

**[07:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=450s)** And then a couple of things to do with opening and closing my blinds.

**[07:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=454s)** These buttons are all connected into home assistant using the stream deck home assistant connection.

**[07:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=458s)** So if I want to turn off the key light, I can just press the button and toggle the Amaran key light that's right here.

**[07:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=464s)** So I have that on a smart plug, nothing too crazy going on there.

**[07:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=468s)** Along with, you know, the key light right is an Elgato key light.

**[07:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=472s)** So if I press that button, that's just a Wi-Fi connection.

**[07:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=475s)** And the hair light again is just on a smart plug way up above my head up there.

**[08:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=482s)** Just to give a bit of background light filled to the room and kind of separate me from the background a little bit probably could be better.

**[08:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=489s)** But, you know, seems to do the trick just fine.

**[08:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=495s)** Okay, so the stream deck's really handy because when I want to stream and stuff like I can open and close the blinds behind me.

**[08:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=501s)** I never really, I like to control the light as much as possible that way.

**[08:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=505s)** I don't have to worry about continuity of time of day of the type of sunlight that's coming and going.

**[08:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=511s)** All that kind of stuff it can get kind of annoying trying to match color between a sunlight day and an overcast day.

**[08:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=518s)** Or if one of those days where the sun's coming and going.

**[08:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=521s)** All right, so that's the basic layout here.

**[08:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=523s)** Let's talk a little bit more about why I've got so many screens here.

**[08:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=528s)** So you can see I've got a 27 inch 4K here, a 27 inch 4K there, the laptop screen.

**[08:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=534s)** I've got this recorder screen right here.

**[08:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=537s)** And then the teleprompter as well.

**[08:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=539s)** And the reason for that is because when you're live streaming or doing any kind of live content,

**[09:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=544s)** you want to be able to see what the stream is doing over here.

**[09:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=547s)** You want to be able to see what your colleagues are doing over here.

**[09:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=550s)** You want any notes and things like that over here.

**[09:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=553s)** And then what I like to do in OBS at least is just bring up a USB capture device that's capturing via HDMI.

**[09:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=563s)** And all this does, I don't know why that's so small right now.

**[09:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=567s)** But all this does is I do a full screen mirror.

**[09:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=573s)** I do a right click and then I go to full screen projector and then monitor.

**[09:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=579s)** And what that does is it puts my ugly mug up here on the screen.

**[09:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=583s)** And this screen up here is a lily put something or other, not entirely sure of the model number.

**[09:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=588s)** But the important thing is it has controls built in to flip the image.

**[09:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=593s)** So this is just a guide gear teleprompter that's up here.

**[09:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=596s)** And this display here lets me flip the image vertically so that I get the correct orientation.

**[10:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=602s)** Of doing everything the right way up.

**[10:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=605s)** But in the middle there's a crosshair.

**[10:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=608s)** I don't know how well that will come across on this little camera.

**[10:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=611s)** But there is a crosshair.

**[10:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=612s)** So what that allows me to do is kind of line up my nose in the middle of shot.

**[10:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=616s)** Just very subconsciously it's one of those things you get into editing.

**[10:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=620s)** And you're like, why am I sat here?

**[10:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=622s)** It's not symmetrical between the speakers.

**[10:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=624s)** And the kind of white ugliness of those blinds throws things off a little bit too.

**[10:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=630s)** Which I tend to crop the shot a little bit.

**[10:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=632s)** So I've moved the crosshair just a little bit off centre of where the screen actually is.

**[10:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=637s)** So that I can line myself up very, very roughly whenever I need to and just make sure that I'm in approximately the right place.

**[10:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=644s)** Then the other thing this lets me do is bring up a teleprompter app.

**[10:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=648s)** This one's called teleprompterpro and it's available on the app store.

**[10:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=652s)** And then I can bring this into OBS and overlay that onto what I'm talking about.

**[10:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=658s)** So when I want to have a script or something like that on the screen,

**[11:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=662s)** you can see that I've just literally got what's appearing in this teleprompter app here.

**[11:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=667s)** So I can just gently tap the mouse or the trackpad and have that scroll.

**[11:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=672s)** And then as I'm talking, if I need to pause because I'm talking too slowly

**[11:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=676s)** or the script is too verbose or whatever I need to add a little bit,

**[11:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=679s)** you can see it just scrolls by nicely on there.

**[11:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=682s)** So this monitor here is about 1080p-ish.

**[11:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=687s)** So it's not 4k, but I don't need it to be.

**[11:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=689s)** It's perfectly sharp enough to read that text from this distance.

**[11:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=693s)** And that allows me to really seriously reduce my recording time.

**[11:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=699s)** When I first started doing this, I tried not to script everything.

**[11:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=703s)** I tried to kind of have just an outline and kind of wing everything.

**[11:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=708s)** So the demo part of the video that I do, where I have a bunch of code,

**[11:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=711s)** I'm trying to show a bunch of steps to achieve an end goal.

**[11:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=714s)** That's fine, because the script kind of writes itself.

**[11:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=717s)** You need to do X to get to Y to get to Z before you can accomplish whatever it is you're trying to do.

**[12:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=723s)** But the intro's to videos where you're trying to come across a bunch of talking points all at once,

**[12:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=728s)** like an exposition type thing.

**[12:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=729s)** Here's why you should care about the solution.

**[12:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=731s)** Here's what we're going to go over today and the phrasing and just making sure that everything's exactly right.

**[12:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=736s)** I've got a pretty interesting process for this.

**[12:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=739s)** So typically, what I'll do is I will start just by doing a voice memo dictation into my phone

**[12:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=745s)** as I might go for a walk or something.

**[12:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=747s)** I'll take the dog out and try and figure out what it is I'm trying to say.

**[12:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=751s)** So let's say this is a video about self-hosted AI, because that's the video I'm working on right now.

**[12:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=757s)** I think to myself, well, how do I want to approach this topic?

**[12:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=760s)** Who's going to be interested?

**[12:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=762s)** And then I'll sort of spit out very, very rough version into my phone as I'm walking around.

**[12:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=769s)** And often there will be two or three minute pauses in those recordings,

**[12:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=773s)** as I'm really thinking about what it is I'm trying to say.

**[12:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=776s)** Then I'll listen to it back myself and think, does that really get the point across that I wanted to get across?

**[13:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=782s)** And then I will put it through a program called Mac Whisper.

**[13:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=786s)** This uses the Whisper transcription technology to kind of transcribe the video into text.

**[13:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=793s)** What I'll then do is I'll put it on a document on the screen and I'll just read it in a fairly reasonable pacing

**[13:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=800s)** just to try and get any of the stutters out or any of the kind of weirdness of converting a written form into a text form.

**[13:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=809s)** Typically, though, because I dictated it in the first place, the turns of phrases and stuff actually work out pretty nicely.

**[13:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=816s)** So then once you're happy with the script, you can iterate it on it as many times as you want and tweak it and all the rest of it.

**[13:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=823s)** Do a few takes and don't be afraid to then watch it back in the editing.

**[13:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=828s)** For me, I do all the editing back there and don't be afraid to just tweak it and go for it and edit bits out that you don't like and it's fine to have jump cuts and things like that.

**[13:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=839s)** Alright, so that's the process of actually scripting a video a little bit behind the scenes there.

**[14:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=843s)** I haven't touched much on this little device in front of me, though. This is called the Ninja 5.

**[14:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=849s)** But in the back, it has a two and a half inch SSD for which I 3D printed a little caddy and I've got a pair of right angle HDMI connections.

**[14:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=858s)** So rather than recording directly onto the SD card of the camera, which means I then have to go round the back of the screen.

**[14:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=866s)** It doesn't sound like a big deal until you do it multiple times.

**[14:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=869s)** Let's say hypothetically, let's say you've just recorded a wonderful section of video and you think to yourself,

**[14:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=878s)** I wish I just said these three or four extra words or this extra sentence.

**[14:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=883s)** You then have to take the SD card out of the editing system.

**[14:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=886s)** Go round the back of the camera, make sure you don't move it for continuity reasons.

**[14:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=890s)** You don't want the camera to suddenly be pointed this way that way.

**[14:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=893s)** Get the SD card in and out and then press record on the back of the camera itself and then walk around the front and actually start delivering your piece to camera.

**[15:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=902s)** Whereas the really nice thing about this is I don't have to touch the camera itself.

**[15:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=907s)** This is just a touch screen so I can monitor what's going on here and press stop, play, record, whatever.

**[15:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=915s)** I can even do things like viewing exposure and I've loaded a custom nut into this display so that I can actually record in what's called log format,

**[15:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=925s)** which preserves a lot of the dynamic range of a shot and then apply a lot a lookup table later on to kind of recover some of the highlights and lowlights and get the shadows down into just where I like them.

**[15:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=936s)** I like the background here to be kind of moody and you can just about make out what's going on back there but not quite enough in enough detail to actually see what is back there.

**[15:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=947s)** Then the camera is just on.

**[15:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=951s)** It's got a clean HDMI feed coming out into the ninja.

**[15:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=955s)** The ninja then does the recording and then has an HDMI out which goes into a USB HDMI capture device which goes into the Thunderbolt dock.

**[16:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=964s)** So that's then how OBS gets the feed.

**[16:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=967s)** Then once OBS has the feed then put it back out onto this screen here so again I can line up my nose and my Kong with the little crosshair that's in the middle of the screen right there.

**[16:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=978s)** So this is a process that took me about six months to dial in until I was fully happy with it and now I have an external recorder.

**[16:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=986s)** I can see right now for example that I'm recording an H265 high quality I used to record in pro res but the file size is this is this is just a 12 minute clip right here.

**[16:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=996s)** This would have been 100 gig pro res file.

**[16:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=999s)** So then you start moving those things around the network and you fill up your SSDs in no time or whatever.

**[16:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1004s)** Whereas by recording an H265 that means that this is going to be a few gigabytes worth of file like maybe five to 10 gig.

**[16:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1014s)** And it just makes it just reduces stress on every single every single step of the editing that goes through.

**[17:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1020s)** The other thing you can probably see on the screen of this little guy is that I'm recording in Canon log three with a lot applied and then in 4k at 29.97 frames per second.

**[17:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1032s)** Really like this little ninja device and it's just powered using a little adaptor that goes into the wall.

**[17:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1037s)** So these things are designed to be portable and kind of clip onto your camera and you can walk around and have a bigger screen than just the viewfinder to look at.

**[17:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1045s)** Alright so that's enough stuff in front of camera.

**[17:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1048s)** I think it's time to actually show you a little bit of what goes on behind here.

**[17:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1053s)** So how is all of this stuff mounted?

**[17:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1056s)** This is one of the errors I'm actually kind of very pleased with and it's this kind of single stand although there are two stands back here more on that in the second.

**[17:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1065s)** Based on the video by Caleb I think from DSLR shooter on YouTube.

**[17:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1070s)** Where does a YouTuber go to learn about how making how to make YouTube videos? Well obviously YouTube.

**[17:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1077s)** And you can see this is all just mounted on a single stand.

**[18:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1080s)** So I have this little shelf back here where I've got just literally got a charger and the next to your my splitter which I actually don't use anymore.

**[18:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1089s)** But I used to use that to get things out to the external monitor.

**[18:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1094s)** But what this allows me to do is get all of the power cables neatly tucked away and kind of Velcro cable tied to this guy with a couple of sandbags at the bottom to counterbalance the weight.

**[18:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1106s)** Let's go to Home Depot and buy the sand for these. That was fun.

**[18:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1110s)** And so back here I've got the what is it the Canon R6 Mark 2 hooked up to a 24 to 70 F2.8 lens I think.

**[18:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1123s)** And you can see it's just nothing you know the camera itself isn't recording but my little screen over there is recording and there's the view that you of course you see in all the telescope YouTube videos.

**[18:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1133s)** The other nice thing about not coming back here very often is that all of my settings I couldn't honestly tell you what my frame rate was until I'm looking at it right now.

**[19:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1140s)** So 150th of a second F4.0 with a nice over 400.

**[19:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1145s)** And then just to mount the teleprompter to the kind of pole that's here that's on wheels and the screen I've got just a standard ball head back here.

**[19:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1157s)** Coupled with what's called a spigot and a metal arm with a super clamp going on to this pipe here.

**[19:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1165s)** Along with another super clamp down here that connects into the back of this kind of adjustable ball head doohickey which is what I used to mount the ninja recorder in the perfect spot.

**[19:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1179s)** Lighting is super important of course and up here I have the Amaran 100X going into a light dome mini.

**[19:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1188s)** I really like this light it just does the job it gets kind of warm but yeah such is life.

**[19:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1197s)** So that's it really that's a quick overview of the single stand setup that I have here in terms of equipment and gear and stuff I have this tool chest.

**[20:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1207s)** Just a mechanics tool chest that is from a very reputable brand.

**[20:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1211s)** And just in here I have a bunch of 3D printed gridfinity accessories you know I've got a bunch of spare spigots to go in the back of these things and more mounting arms and HDMI cables that I used to use these coming directly out of the camera before I got the ninja going properly.

**[20:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1229s)** And now I don't use them at all but such as progress sometimes.

**[20:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1235s)** You can see here just a bunch of you know failed experiments really that's what these drawers contain because all the stuff I used to actually make the videos is in use as you might expect.

**[20:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1246s)** As you go down things get slightly less organized I've got thing you know gear for my cables for my sliders and this thing's really interesting this is the 8M mini pro ISO.

**[20:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1256s)** So this has 4 HDMI inputs on the back and 1 HDMI out and this will record all 4 separate inputs as a isolated signal to an external SSD but only in 1080p which is why I don't use it as much as I would like.

**[21:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1271s)** What have we got here as well yes an external zoom audio recorder which I don't use much now because I have my RE20 going directly into a baringer UMC 204 HD XLR recorder over there but if I'm traveling I want to have good quality audio that's the way to go or doing a wide shot with hardware or something.

**[21:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1296s)** A bunch more grip gear and stuff you know clamps and just random stuff tossed in here along with at the bottom I think I've got a DJI Ronin gimbal and the case my microphone so that is pretty much I think a proper behind the scenes look at how I make a telescope YouTube video.

**[22:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1322s)** The one thing left to do is show you what happens once I've stopped recording I suppose so if I flip you round again what I'll do is I'll press stock on the ninja recorder and then pull out the SSD that's in here and you can see it's just a bog standard crucial Sata SSD and then I'll turn around and I'll get onto the desk behind me and literally all I will do is I'll get up to this USB C.

**[22:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1350s)** Sata adapter shove that in there like that open up the MacBook and you can see there I have a 20 gig file I'll then bring that into Final Cut which is my editing software of choice and I've got a bunch of presets to get the log files all done correctly and the picture and picture stuff set up just how I like it.

**[22:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1374s)** And then I'll go through Final Cut and edit the thing and that really is that really is it I think that's that's pretty much all you need to know in terms of how I make a YouTube video typically for tail scale.

**[23:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1385s)** There's been a lot of learning a lot of mistakes going to get into this point the hardest part for anybody looking to get into this stuff just start just start making videos the first few won't be any good.

**[23:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1399s)** The next 50 might be okay and then eventually might begin to feel like you know what you're doing and at that point that's where you can actually start to really hone your craft and figure out what's going on but.

**[23:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1412s)** My advice would be such as it is try and keep everything that you can separate so like for your recording desk should be ideally a separate piece of infrastructure that you deal with separately you know you don't want to be worrying about having the editor open and crashing in the middle of recording session and recording your colleagues slack conversations popping up as notifications and.

**[24:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1441s)** Separate systems separate roles completely within your infrastructure is the way to go and then on the back end obviously make sure you've got a decent nas I've got 10 gig networking with fiber to connect all this stuff together so that I can just throw files around like it's nothing.

**[24:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1458s)** You can you can cope probably just fine with external SSDs and kind of juggle those for a bit but very quickly you'll start filling those up and start juggling them around and then before you know you spent as much money as you would have spent on a nas anyway just buying random external hard drives so that's probably all you need to see for a tail scale kind of studio tool and secret little bit for those of you that make it to the end.

**[24:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1483s)** The reason I wanted to give you a quick tour of this room today and kind of my workflow today is that as we speak right now there are people up there above my head converting my attic so that I can turn this spare bedroom back into a bedroom.

**[24:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1499s)** And up there is going to be a brand new tail scale studio sharing 50 50 with tail scale and some of my other personal projects but that's that is a very exciting milestone for me and it kind of signals my intent as a as a creator as to how I want to kind of take things a bit more seriously in the future and.

**[25:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSYsaZJEzCs&t=1522s)** Create a lot more tutorials create a lot more just home lab content in general and you know take take my YouTube channel to the next level there we go that is the behind the scenes of the tail scale YouTube channel thank you so much for watching and until next time I've been Alex from tail scale.
