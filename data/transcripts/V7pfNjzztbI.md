# Remote Multiplayer Factorio Space Age Server with no Port Forwarding

**[00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=0s)** To celebrate the release of Factorio Space Age, here's how to set up a Remote Multiplayer

**[00:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=4s)** Factorio Headless Server in Docker. First of all, you're going to need a Linux server.

**[00:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=9s)** Check, I have one of those. Next, you're going to need a Docker Compose snippet. I'll

**[00:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=13s)** be linked to this in the description down below. Next, we want to start up the server

**[00:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=17s)** with a Docker Compose up. Next, we want to launch Factorio. So on the Mac at least, if

**[00:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=21s)** I jump up to my menu bar and go to Network Devices, My Devices, and then click on Deep

**[00:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=26s)** Thought, that's going to copy the IP address for Deep Thought to my clipboard. Next, I want

**[00:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=30s)** to click on Multiplayer, Connect to Address, and then just paste this into my Multiplayer

**[00:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=35s)** Connection tab. It's going to synchronize the mods between the server and my client.

**[00:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=40s)** Now, the only connection that I have back to this server is over 5G from my phone, because

**[00:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=46s)** I'm in the park. I'm outside. And there we go. We are connected into a Factorio Multiplayer

**[00:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V7pfNjzztbI&t=50s)** server without touching any networking configuration whatsoever. Thanks to TailScale.
