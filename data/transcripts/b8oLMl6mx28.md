# Tailscale ACL tags demo

**[00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=0s)** Hi, I'm Maya from Tailscale, here to talk about ACL tags.

**[00:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=4s)** ACLs in Tailscale are how you define what devices can talk to what other devices is part

**[00:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=9s)** of your tailnet.

**[00:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=10s)** ACL tags allow you to assign tags to a device and then use that tag to restrict its access.

**[00:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=16s)** For example, you might assign a tag PROD to production servers, then create an ACL allowing

**[00:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=22s)** the group SRE to access devices with TAG PROD.

**[00:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=28s)** I can tag a device from the machines page or include an ACL tag as part of an authentication

**[00:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=37s)** key when I spin up a new device.

**[00:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=39s)** I have an off key here with a demo tag.

**[00:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=43s)** To use it on my server, all I have to do is tailscale up and specify the off key.

**[00:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=50s)** Ta-da, connect it.

**[00:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=54s)** This device will connect to my network with the ACL tag already applied.

**[00:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=58s)** That means that servers can have appropriate access as soon as they come up.

**[01:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=b8oLMl6mx28&t=62s)** Check out tailscale.com to get started.
